Query: 'python tensorflow image classification'

## Solution:

you should use the same preprocessing method  that was used to train your model. If you used tf.keras preprocessing then you should use tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img. If you used numpy then your inference script should also use numpy preprocessing.


lets suppose while training you are using the flag "interpolation=lanczos" in your ImageDataGenerator or image_dataset_from_directory then while inference you should use the same flag i.e " interpolation=lanczos" in tf.keras.preprocessinh.image.load_img . when you don't mention the interpolation while training, the default interpolation method is used.
