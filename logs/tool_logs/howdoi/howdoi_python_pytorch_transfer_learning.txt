Query: 'python pytorch transfer learning'

## Solution:

In the first code snippet, you are downloading a model from TorchVision (with random weights), and then loading your (locally stored) weights to it.


In the second example you are loading a locally stored model (and its weights).


The former will be slower since you need to connect to the server hosting the model and download it, as opposed to a local file, but it is more reproduceable not relying on your local file. Also, the time difference should be a one-off initialisation, and they should have the same time complexity (as by the point you are performing inference the model has already been loaded in both, and they are equivalent).
