# You already have tf.data.Dataset objects after load
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tfds.load('mnist', split=['train', 'test'], 
                                                  batch_size=-1, as_supervised=True)

# But you are reshaping them in a strange manner...
x_train = tf.reshape(x_train, shape=(x_train.shape[0], 784))
x_test  = tf.reshape(x_test, shape=(x_test.shape[0], 784))

# And building from slices...
ds_train = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train))
# Unreadable rescaling (there are built-ins for that)
