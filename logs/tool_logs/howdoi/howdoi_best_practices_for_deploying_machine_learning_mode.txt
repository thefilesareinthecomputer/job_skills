Query: 'best practices for deploying machine learning models'

## Solution:

Not to sure what you're looking for here but Google Cloud Platform has some good storage, big data, machine learning, and computational tools 



They all have tutorials and Google even gives you 300$ credit to go ahead and get started! 



All you need is a google account and a credit card. (you don't get charged if you don't go over the 300$ credit, and it's not an automatic charge either)
