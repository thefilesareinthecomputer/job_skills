Query: 'howdoi make a simple classification algorithm in Python'

## Solution:

You are indeed describing a classification problem, which can be solved with machine learning.



In this problem, your features are the words in the description. You should use the [Bag Of Words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model - which basically says that the words and their number of occurrences for each word is what matters to the classification process.



To solve your problem, here are the steps you should do:





Create a feature extractor - that given a description of a restaurant, returns the "features" (under the Bag Of Words model explained above) of this restaurant (denoted as example in the literature).


Manually label a set of examples, each will be labeled with the desired class (Chinese, Belgian, Junk food,...)


Feed your labeled examples into a learning algorithm. It will generate a classifier. From personal experience, [SVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) usually gives the best results, but there are other choices such as [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier), [Neural Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and [Decision Trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) (usually [C4.5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm) is used), each has its own advantage.


When a new (unlabeled) example (restaurant) comes - extract the features and feed it to your classifier - it will tell you what it thinks it is (and usually - what is the probability the classifier is correct).









Evaluation:

Evaluation of your algorithm can be done with [cross-validation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29), or seperating a test set out of your labeled examples that will be used only for evaluating how accurate the algorithm is.







Optimizations:



From personal experience - here are some optimizations I found helpful for the feature extraction:





[Stemming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and eliminating [stop words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) usually helps a lot.


Using [Bi-Grams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) tends to improve accuracy (though increases the feature space significantly).


Some classifiers are prone to large feature space (SVM not included), there are some ways to overcome it, such as decreasing the dimensionality of your features. [PCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) is one thing that can help you with it. [Genethic Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) are also (empirically) pretty good for subset selection.









Libraries:



Unfortunately, I am not fluent enough with python, but here are some libraries that might be helpful:





[Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) might help you a lot with the text analysis, for example - stemming can be done with [EnglishAnalyzer](http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_1_0/api/all/org/apache/lucene/analysis/en/EnglishAnalyzer.html). There is a python version of lucene called [PyLucene](http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/), which I believe might help you out.


[Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) is an open source library that implements a lot of useful things for Machine Learning - many classifiers and feature selectors included.


[Libsvm](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) is a library that implements the SVM algorithm.
