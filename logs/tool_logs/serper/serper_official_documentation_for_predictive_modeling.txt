mple to capture underlying patterns. Explainability and Interpretability: Ensure that your model’s predictions are explainable and can be interpreted by stakeholders. The ability to explain a model’s decisions is critical, especially for sensitive applications. Employ explainable AI techniques (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP)) to make model decision-making processes transparent and understandable. Ethical Considerations: Ensure your AI model complies with regulatory and compliance standards. Implement regular audits and mitigation strategies to address the risk of inaccurate predictions. Scalability and Efficiency: Consider if your model can scale to handle larger datasets or s

Semi-supervised machine learning also uses clustering algorithms. UNC refers to this methodology as supervised clustering. The method is considered semi-supervised because a portion of the studies sent to clustering have been manually reviewed for relevance. These manually reviewed studies, also called seeds, are typically known relevant studies. The seeds are clustered along with unlabeled data and can provide another signal (beyond the keywords generated by the algorithm) as to which clusters are likely to contain studies o
