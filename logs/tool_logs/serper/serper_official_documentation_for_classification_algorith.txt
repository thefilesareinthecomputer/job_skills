If you've ever been to a bookstore, you’ve probably experienced the book-location dilemma. Say you're looking for Atlas Shrugged , and you know it’s a genre mix of science fiction, mystery, and romance. Now, which section will you go to to find it? The science fiction, the romance section? The document classification problem relates to library, information, and computer sciences. It concerns the way we categorize items in databases and inventories. As today’s digital storages can serve large amounts of items, it becomes difficult to categorize them manually. So businesses employ machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for classification tasks. In this article, we’ll explore the essence of document classification,

 for everyday operations. There are several scenarios for implementing a classifier. Keep in mind that you can’t classify texts before they’re digitized. So, if you have scanned or physical documents, you need to digitize them first using optical character recognition. Document and text digitization with OCR Document classification may involve physical documents since in industries such as banking , insurance , and healthcare a vast amount of documents are still on paper. Which forces businesses to establish complex workflows to convert handwritten or typed data into a digital format for classification and other tasks. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows for the detection and extraction of text information from s

cleaning) and used to create an ML model. The model is trained to detect patterns in the data linked to category. Inspect the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You need to tune it by adjusting parameters. Also, by improving feature extraction or trying different models. You must do this until performance is acceptably good. Manual document classification involves a human operator categorizing each document after close inspection. This process is error-prone, labor-intensive, and time-consuming, especially when handling large and numerous documents.Â Automatic document categorisation involves using machine learning to analyse and categorize documents.Â This kind of sorting saves time. It scales

In this age of rapid technological advancement, most people are familiar with AI. We’ve likely all read the articles about automation destroying jobs, or a future of robots taking over the world. While those articles are more based on science fiction than a tangible future of AI, it certainly keeps interest in AI top-of-mind for many people. There are dozens of examples of AI that everyday consumers may use, such as facial recognition, auto-correct, search engines, or social media algorithms. But have you ever wondered how these programs work? AI runs off of algorithms, but not all AI algorithms are the same. They’re developed with different goals and methods. In this article, we’ll talk about the four major categories of AI algorithms and

proximity. However, Gaussian models are a little more versatile in the shapes of the clusters they allow. Picture a graph with all your data points plotted out. K-means clustering only allows data to be clustered in circles with the centroid in the center of each cluster. Gaussian mixture can handle data that lands on the graph in more linear patterns, allowing for oblong-shaped clusters. This allows for greater clarity in clustering if one datapoint lands inside the circle of another cluster. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms Some AI algorithms can use either supervised or unsupervised data input and still function. They might have slightly different applications based on their status. K-nearest neighbor algorithm K-nearest neigh
