 faster to a solution. Task-Specific Adaptation: Fine-tuning is necessary when you have a pre-trained language model, and you want to adapt it to perform a specific task. For example, you might fine tune a language model for sentiment analysis or text generation for a particular domain like medical or legal documents using domain specific data. Continuous Learning: Fine-tuning is useful for continuous learning scenarios where the model needs to adapt to changing data and requirements over time. It allows you to periodically update the model without starting from scratch. Bias Mitigation: If you're concerned about biases present in a pre-trained model, fine-tuning can be used to reduce or counteract those biases by providing balanced and rep

tasks to improve the model's performance. The model can develop a more robust and generalized understanding of the data by learning to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This approach leads to improved performance, especially when the tasks it will perform are closely related or when there is limited data for individual tasks. Multi-task learning requires a labeled dataset for each task, making it an inherent component of supervised fine-tuning. 4. Few-shot learning Few-shot learning enables a model to adapt to a new task with little task-specific data. The idea is to leverage the vast knowledge model has already gained from pre-training to learn effectively from just a few examples of the new task. This approach is beneficial when the
