d for analyzing data to obtain valuable insights and make better business decisions. ETL data pipeline architecture is layered. Each subsystem is essential, and sequentially, each sub-system feeds into the next until data reaches its destination. ETL data pipeline architecture | Source: Author Data Discovery: Data can be sourced from various types of systems, such as databases, file systems, APIs, or streaming sources. We also need data profiling i.e. data discovery, to understand if the data is appropriate for ETL. This involves looking at the data structure, relationships, and content. Ingestion: You can pull the data from the various data sources into a staging area or data lake. Extraction can be done using various techniques such as AP

res your company can have high-level control over how and why data is accessed. Real-time processing In the past, when people needed to be deeply involved in ETL processes, they would do something called batch processing. This is where they would run ETL on data files at a specific recurrence—sometimes daily, weekly, or monthly. While batching helped people streamline their processes, focus on one data pipeline at a time, and ensure all the usable data was collected, it also created serious lag time by delaying when normalized data was available for analysis. ML tools can help process data in real time or nearly real time. They continually process data as it comes in and ensure that downstream users are able to get the most up-to-date infor

 Not all AI tools are created equal. These are the “five E’s” to seek in an AI for ETL solution: Easy: An AI for ETL pipeline should be exceptionally easy to use. The best are user-friendly, GUI-based offerings with drag-and-drop functionality to build data pipelines. It’s also a good idea to look for pre-built templates to jumpstart data engineering projects and rich metadata of data pipelines for quick and efficient setup. Efficient: Any option should be highly efficient. Look for a platform that features intelligent recommendations to guide data engineers through the design process. Superior still would be a general-purpose data management assistant designed to simplify many data-related tasks by providing an LLM-based natural language i

everything from real-time analytics to machine learning applications. Here are six key components that are fundamental to building and maintaining an effective data pipeline. Data Sources The first component of a modern data pipeline is the data source, which is the origin of the data your business leverages. This can include any system or application that generates or collects data, such as: Behavioral Data: User behavior data that provides insights into how customers interact with your products or services. Transactional Data: Sales and product records that capture critical business transactions and operations. Third-Party Data: External data sources that your company does not collect directly but integrates to enhance insights or support
