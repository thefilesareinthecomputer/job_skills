2.3. Clustering # Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module sklearn.cluster . Each clustering algorithm comes in two variants: a class, that implements the fit method to learn the clusters on train data, and a function, that, given train data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding to the different clusters. For the class, the labels over the training data can be found in the labels_ attribute. Input data One important thing to note is that the algorithms implemented in this module can take different kinds of matrix as input. All the methods accept standard data matrices of shape (n_samples, n_features) . These can be obtained from the classes in the sklearn.feature_extraction module. For AffinityPropagation ,

eeding” Arthur, David, and Sergei Vassilvitskii, Proceedings of the eighteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms , Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2007) 2.3.2.2. Mini Batch K-Means # The MiniBatchKMeans is a variant of the KMeans algorithm which uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting to optimise the same objective function. Mini-batches are subsets of the input data, randomly sampled in each training iteration. These mini-batches drastically reduce the amount of computation required to converge to a local solution. In contrast to other algorithms that reduce the convergence time of k-means, mini-batch k-means produces results that are generally only slightly worse than the sta

Machine learning datasets can have millions of examples, but not all clustering algorithms scale efficiently. Many clustering algorithms compute the similarity between all pairs of examples, which means their runtime increases as the square of the number of examples \(n\), denoted as \(O(n^2)\) in complexity notation. \(O(n^2)\) algorithms are not practical for datasets with millions of examples. The k-means algorithm has a complexity of \(O(n)\), meaning that the algorithm scales linearly with \(n\). This algorithm will be the focus of this course. Types of clu

fortable assuming a particular underlying distribution of the data, you should use a different algorithm. Figure 3: Example of distribution-based clustering. Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, not surprisingly, is well suited to hierarchical data, such as taxonomies. See Comparison of 61 Sequenced Escherichia coli Genomes by Oksana Lukjancenko, Trudy Wassenaar & Dave Ussery for an example. Any number of clusters can be chosen by cutting the tree at the right level. Figure 4: Example of a hierarchical tree clustering animals.

for understanding diseases and developing treatments. This can lead to breakthroughs in personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the genetic profiles of individual patients. Clustering Algorithms Demystified: An Overview Let’s dive into some of the most popular clustering algorithms. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so understanding how they work is key to choosing the right tool for your data. K-means Clustering K-means is one of the simplest and most widely used clustering algorithms. It partitions data into K clusters, where K is a number you specify in advance. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean. Since K-means relies on Euclidean distance, it can only be used with numerical, not cat
