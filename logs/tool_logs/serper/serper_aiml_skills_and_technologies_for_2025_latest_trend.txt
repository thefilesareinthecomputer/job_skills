ecosystems, user-friendly tools and competitive pricing are likely to take the lead. 5. AI applications and data sets become more domain-specific Leading AI labs, like OpenAI and Anthropic, claim to be pursuing the ambitious goal of creating artificial general intelligence ( AGI ), commonly defined as AI that can perform any task a human can. But AGI -- or even the comparatively limited capabilities of today's foundation models -- is far from necessary for most business applications. For enterprises, interest in narrow, highly customized models started almost as soon as the generative AI hype cycle began. A narrowly tailored business application simply doesn't require the degree of versatility necessary for a consumer-facing chatbot. "There

94% of data and AI leaders said that interest in AI is leading to a greater focus on data. Since traditional analytical AI has been around for several decades, we think they were referring to GenAIâ€™s impact. In another survey that we mentioned in last yearâ€™s AI trends article, there was substantial evidence that most companies hadnâ€™t yet started to really manage data to get ready for generative AI. The great majority of the data that GenAI works with is relatively unstructured, in forms such as text, images, video, and the like. A leader at one large insurance organization recently shared with Randy that 97% of the companyâ€™s data was unstructured. Many companies are interested in using GenAI to help manage and provide access to their own da
