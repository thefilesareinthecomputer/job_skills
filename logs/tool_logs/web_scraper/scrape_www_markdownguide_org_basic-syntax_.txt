# Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide

## Main Content

The Markdown elements outlined in the original design document. Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document. There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors â those are noted inline wherever possible. To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g.,### My Header). Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of==characters for heading level 1 or--characters for heading level 2. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name. You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility. To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on. Unless theparagraph is in a list, donât indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs. To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return. This is the first line.And this is the second line. You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as âtrailing whitespaceâ) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but itâs controversial. Itâs hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown applicationsupports HTML, you can use the<br>HTML tag. For compatibility, use trailing white space or the<br>HTML tag at the end of the line. There are two other options I donât recommend using. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (\) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isnât a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages donât require anything at the end of the line â just type return and theyâll create a line break. You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic. To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold the middle of a word for emphasis. To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word for emphasis. To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. For compatibility, use asterisks to bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis. To create a blockquote, add a>in front of a paragraph. Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a>on the blank lines between the paragraphs. Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood. Blockquotes can be nested. Add a>>in front of the paragraph you want to nest. Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle. The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood. Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used â youâll need to experiment to see which ones work. For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes. You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists. To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donât have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g.,1) First item), but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isnât a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only. To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list. If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) toescapethe period. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, donât mix and match delimiters in the same list â pick one and stick with it. To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples. I need to add another paragraph below the second list item. A blockquote would look great below the second list item. Code blocksare normally indented four spaces or one tab. When theyâre in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs. You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa. To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`). If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``). To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab. To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves. For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules. To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g.,[Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g.,(https://duckduckgo.com)). You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL. To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets. Toemphasizelinks, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links ascode, add backticks in the brackets. I love supporting theEFF.This is theMarkdown Guide.See the section oncode. Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read. The first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link youâre storing elsewhere in your document. Although not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation. This means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link: The second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes: This means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link: You can place this second part of the link anywhere in your Markdown document. Some people place them immediately after the paragraph in which they appear while other people place them at the end of the document (like endnotes or footnotes). Say you add a URL as astandard URL linkto a paragraph and it looks like this in Markdown: Though it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as displayed really doesnât add much to the existing raw text other than making it harder to read. To fix that, you could format the URL like this instead: In both instances above, the rendered output would be identical: In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was ahobbit-hole, and that means comfort. Markdown applications donât agree on how to handle spaces in the middle of a URL. For compatibility, try to URL encode any spaces with%20. Alternatively, if your Markdown applicationsupports HTML, you could use theaHTML tag. Parentheses in the middle of a URL can also be problematic. For compatibility, try to URL encode the opening parenthesis (() with%28and the closing parenthesis ()) with%29. Alternatively, if your Markdown applicationsupports HTML, you could use theaHTML tag. To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses. To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character. * Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list. You can use a backslash to escape the following characters. Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying thecolor of textor changing the width of an image. To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file. For security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check your Markdown applicationâs documentation. Some applications support only a subset of HTML tags. Use blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like<div>,<table>,<pre>, and<p>from the surrounding content. Try not to indent the tags with tabs or spaces â that can interfere with the formatting. You canât use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example,<p>italic and **bold**</p>wonât work. Learn Markdown in 60 pages.
