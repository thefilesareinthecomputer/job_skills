# Wikipedia: Fine-tuning (deep learning)

In deep learning, fine-tuning is an approach to transfer learning in which the parameters of a pre-trained neural network model are trained on new data. Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network, or on only a subset of its layers, in which case the layers that are not being fine-tuned are "frozen" (i.e., not changed during backpropagation). A model may also be augmented with "adapters" that consist of far fewer parameters than the original model, and fine-tuned in a parameter-efficient way by tuning the weights of the adapters and leaving the rest of the model's weights frozen.
For some architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, it is common to keep the earlier layers (those closest to the input layer) frozen, as they capture lower-level features, while later layers often discern high-level features that can be more related to the task that the model is trained on.
Models that are pre-trained on large, general corpora are usually fine-tuned by reusing their parameters as a starting point and adding a task-specific layer trained from scratch. Fine-tuning the full model is also common and often yields better results, but is more computationally expensive.
Fine-tuning is typically accomplished via supervised learning, but there are also techniques to fine-tune a model using weak supervision. Fine-tuning can be combined with a reinforcement learning from human feedback-based objective to produce language models such as ChatGPT (a fine-tuned version of GPT mo...
