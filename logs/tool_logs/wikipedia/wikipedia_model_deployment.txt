Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) describes wireless communication between a vehicle and any entity that may affect, or may be affected by, the vehicle. Sometimes called C-V2X, it is a vehicular communication system that is intended to improve road safety and traffic efficiency while reducing pollution and saving energy.  
The automotive and communications industries, along with the U.S. government, European Union and South Korea are actively promoting V2X and C-V2X as potentially life-saving, pollution-reducing technologies. The U.S. Department of Transport has said V2X technologies offer significant transportation safety and mobility benefits. The U.S. NHTSA estimates a minimum of 13% reduction in traffic accidents if a V2V system were implemented, resulting in 439,000 fewer crashes per year. V2X technology is already being used in Europe and China.
There are two standards for dedicated V2X communications depending on the underlying wireless technology being used: (1) WLAN-based, and (2) cellular-based. V2X also incorporates various more specific types of communication including :

Vehicle-to-Device (V2D) - Bluetooth / WiFi-Direct, e.g. Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.
Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) - information exchange with the smart grid to balance loads more efficiently.
Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), also known as Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)
Vehicle-to-Load (V2L)
Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) - communication based on Cellular (3GPP) / IEEE 802.11p.
Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C) - e.g. OTA updat...
