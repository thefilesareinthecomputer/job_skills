Hereâs a look at the best ones this year. Python was released in 1991 and is one of the most widely used programming languages today [ 1 ]. Itâs efficient and easy to learn, and one of its greatest features is its open-source libraries available for users. The libraries allow users to choose from frameworks that they can build off of to produce new machine learning (ML) models . Whether you're already familiar with machine learning in your career or want to get started, this field holds plenty of growth opportunities. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expects jobs in the field will grow much faster than the rate of all jobs in the US [ 2 ]. In this article, you'll learn more about Python libraries and explore nine that are best for machine learning. Afterward, if you want to start building your Python skills today, consider enrolling in the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody Specialization . What is a Python library?Â Python libraries are collections of modules that contain useful codes and functions, eliminating the need to write them from scratch. There are tens of thousands of Python libraries that help machine learning developers, as well as professionals working in data science, data visualization, and more.Â Python is the preferred language for machine learning because its syntax and commands are closely related to English, making it efficient and easy to learn. Compared with C++ , R , Ruby , and Java , Python remains one of the simplest languages, enabling accessibility, versatility, and portability. It can operate on nearly any operating system or platform. 9 best Python libraries for machine learning If youâre working with machine learning and deep learning projects, there are thousands of Python libraries to choose from, and they can vary in size, quality, and diversity. Here is a curated list of the best Python libraries to help you get started on your machine learning journey. This list is based on popularity, derived from their reputation among Python library users.Â Â 1. NumPy NumPy is a popular Python library for multi-dimensional array and matrix processing because it can be used to perform a great variety of mathematical operations. Its capability to handle linear algebra, Fourier transform, and more, makes NumPy ideal for machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) projects , allowing users to manipulate the matrix to easily improve machine learning performance. NumPy is faster and easier to use than most other Python libraries. For an introduction to Python libraries like Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, check out the University of Michiganâs Statistics with Python specialization. 2. Scikit-learn Scikit-learn is a very popular machine learning library that is built on NumPy and SciPy. It supports most of the classic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms , and it can also be used for data mining, modeling, and analysis. Scikit-learnâs simple design offers a user-friendly library for those new to machine learning. 3. Pandas Pandas is another Python library that is built on top of NumPy, responsible for preparing high-level data sets for machine learning and training. It relies on two types of data structures , one-dimensional (series) and two-dimensional (DataFrame). This allows Pandas to be applicable in a variety of industries, including finance, engineering, and statistics. Unlike the slow-moving animals themselves, the Pandas library is quick, compliant, and flexible. 4. TensorFlow TensorFlow âs open-source Python library specializes in whatâs called differentiable programming, meaning it can automatically compute a functionâs derivatives within high-level language. Both machine learning and deep learning models are easily developed and evaluated with TensorFlowâs flexible architecture and framework. TensorFlow can be used to visualize machine learning models on both desktop and mobile. DeepLearning.AI's project-based TensorFlow specialization is perfect for anyone ready to deep-dive into applied machine learning. Customize ML models with four hands-on courses. 5. Seaborn Seaborn is another open-source Python library based on Matplotlib (which focuses on plotting and data visualization) but featuring Pandasâ data structures. It is often used in ML projects because it can generate plots of learning data. Of all the Python libraries, it produces the most aesthetically pleasing graphs and plots, making it an effective choice if you also use it for marketing and data analysis . 6. Theano Theano is a Python library that focuses on numerical computation and is specifically made for machine learning. It is able to optimize and evaluate mathematical models and matrix calculations that use multi-dimensional arrays to create ML models. Theano is almost exclusively used by machine learning and deep learning developers or programmers. 7. Keras Keras is a Python library that is designed specifically for developing neural networks for ML models. It can run on top of Theano and TensorFlow to train neural networks . Keras is flexible, portable, user-friendly, and easily integrated with multiple functions.Â Practice your Python skills independently with tutorials Not ready to commit to a course or a boot camp yet? You can read step-by-step guides for troubleshooting Python basics like syntax , if-else statements , exceptions , and working with loops in Coursera's free programming tutorials . 8. PyTorch PyTorch is an open-source machine learning Python library based on the C programming language framework, Torch. It is mainly used in ML applications that involve natural language processing or computer vision. PyTorch is known for being exceptionally fast at executing large, dense data sets and graphs.Â 9. Matplotlib Matplotlib is a Python library focused on data visualization and primarily used for creating beautiful graphs, plots, histograms, and bar charts. It is compatible with plotting data from SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas. If you have experience using other types of graphing tools, Matplotlib might be the most intuitive choice for you. Advance your knowledge of Python libraries on Coursera Anybody can learn Python. Whether you're just starting out or want to learn specific Python libraries, Coursera has a program for you. Consider enrolling in one of the following courses to build your skills today: To learn to program and analyze data with Python, enroll in the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody Specialization . In as little as two months, you'll learn how to develop programs to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data. For PyTorch, Keras, and Tensorflow skills, consider IBM's Deep Learning with PyTorch, Keras and TensorFlow Professional Certificate . There, you'll learn how to train linear and logistic regression models, create shareable projects, and build advanced CNNs and transformer models. To build AI apps with TensorFlow, try DeepLearning.AI's DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate . Explore best practices for TensorFlow, build natural language processing systems, and handle real-world image data.
