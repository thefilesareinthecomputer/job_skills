This is a broad category, and includes things such as virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and facial-recognition technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence where the machine is given data to learn how to complete certain tasks. Predictive AI versus Generative AI The UNC Health Sciences Library (HSL) has a set of internal tools that can be applied to systematic reviews and other large scale evidence-syntheses to prioritize citations for screening. These tools use predictive AI models rather than generative AI. Application of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) to article screening is evolving rapidly. Currently, there are no commercial products available that use GenAI to categorize citations as relevant or not relevant. Machine learning approaches (predictive AI) used by HSL are available to prioritize citations for screening. This guide will be updated when resources and tested approaches become available. Generative AI tools take in large amounts of training data to learn how to produce or generate content on their own. ChatGPT (text generation) and DALL-E (image generation) are examples of generative AI tools. In contrast, predictive AI uses labeled data (i.e. categorized by humans) to make predictions about future outcomes. Predictive AI is well-established and has been used often in various fields such as weather forecasting and finance. While predictive AI models have been used for decades, they have not been adopted on a large scale for systematic reviews or literature-based research. With the growing amount of published research, it is likely that AI will become an integral part of the research process. Predictive AI models can be effectively used to prioritize citations for human review. Extensive testing of the methodology particularly for biomedical literature can be found in peer-reviewed studies dating back to 2000 (Mostafa & Lam, 2000) .

Generative AI vs Predictive AI This YouTube video explains the key characteristics of generative AI compared to predictive AI, and provides examples (10 minutes). Generative AI vs. predictive AI: What’s the difference? This IBM blog post explains the differences between generative AI and predictive AI. Predictive AI for Systematic Reviews There are four types of predictive AI/ML that have applications for systematic reviews including: 1.) unsupervised machine learning (clustering), 2.) semi-supervised machine learning , 3.) supervised machine learning , and 4.) active machine learning . Generally speaking, these approaches work best on projects with 3,000 or more unique citations, although, clustering may be used for topic analysis on smaller datasets. You can find more information about each of these approaches on this page. Unsupervised Machine Learning What is unsupervised machine learning (clustering)? Unsupervised machine learning, or clustering, uses algorithms such as k-means , Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) , or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) .​ ​At HSL, we primarily use k-means clustering which groups data into a fixed number (k) of clusters based on text similarities in titles and abstracts. Citations from a literature search, most commonly using titles and abstracts, are run through k-means clustering, which creates groups, or clusters, based on words commonly featured in each. Researchers can view the keywords that were used to develop the cluster, use them to see the distribution of literature within the search results, and help define or narrow a literature search topic. Input List of citations, including titles and abstracts for each. These data are unlabeled, meaning the user does not assign relevance to any of the input citations. Output Clusters of citations with keyword summaries for each cluster. In the image above, each shape represents one article. Unlabeled titles and abstracts are input, and clusters of articles based on text similarities of input data. Benefits of Clustering Does not require developing a set of seed studies (also called labeled or training data) Provides insight into themes appearing withing the entire corpus Quick and simple Data-driven approach Good for refining the literature search of large or complex reviews Limitations of Clustering Relies on human judgment to prioritize clusters for screening, which requires subject matter expertise No prediction of the number of relevant studies in the search Reduced precision as clusters are not based on seeds or a training set Example of Clustering Output from a Systematic Review Search In the example below, titles and abstracts of all citations from a large systematic review literature search were analyzed using clustering. Each citation is assigned to one of ten groups based on text analysis. The output from clustering is shown below. Keywords for each cluster are generated by the algorithm and can provide insight into topics found in the corpus. Subject matter experts may use the keywords to look closer at citations in a particular cluster.

Semi-supervised machine learning also uses clustering algorithms. UNC refers to this methodology as supervised clustering. The method is considered semi-supervised because a portion of the studies sent to clustering have been manually reviewed for relevance. These manually reviewed studies, also called seeds, are typically known relevant studies. The seeds are clustered along with unlabeled data and can provide another signal (beyond the keywords generated by the algorithm) as to which clusters are likely to contain studies o
