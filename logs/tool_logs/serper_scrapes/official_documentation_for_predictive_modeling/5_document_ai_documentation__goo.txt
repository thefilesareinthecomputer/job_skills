Document AI is a platform and a family of solutions that help businesses to transform documents into structured data backed by machine learning. In this blog post we'll walk you through how to use Serverless technology to process documents with Cloud Functions, and with workflows of business processes orchestrating microservices, API calls, and functions, thanks to Workflows. Document AI Workflows Learn more arrow_forward Training Training and tutorials Diving into your documents with Document AI We recently announced the GA of the Document AI Platform, Google's solution for automating and validating documents to streamline document workflows. Important business data is not always readily available in computer-readable formats. This is what we consider dark formats such as pdfs, handwritten forms and images. Document AI Learn more arrow_forward Training Training and tutorials Using Document AI to automate procurement workflows We recently announced the GA of the Document AI Platform, Google's solution for automating and validating documents to streamline document workflows. Important business data is not always readily available in computer-readable formats. This is what we consider dark formats such as pdfs, handwritten forms and images. Document AI Learn more arrow_forward Training Training and tutorials Building a document understanding pipeline with Google Cloud Document understanding is the practice of using AI and machine learning to extract data and insights from text and paper sources such as emails, PDFs, scanned documents, and more. In the past, capturing this unstructured or "dark data" has been an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process requiring manual data entry. Today, AI and machine learning have made great advances towards automating this process, enabling businesses to derive insights from and take advantage of this data that had been previously untapped.

Document AI Learn more arrow_forward Use case Use cases Add intelligence to your document processing with Google's Enterprise Knowledge Graph With Document AI, we are bringing the power of Google search to help customers understand their documents. This means that the same Google knowledge graph technology that helps you find the name, address or phone number of your favorite restaurant can now enrich your document extraction with the right name, fully qualified address, and updated phone number. Document AI Enterprise Knowledge Graph Learn more arrow_forward Use case Use cases Google AI Blog: Extracting Structured Data from Templatic Documents Templatic documents, such as receipts, bills, insurance quotes, and others, are extremely common and critical in a diverse range of business workflows. Currently, processing these documents is largely a manual effort, and automated systems that do exist are based on brittle and error-prone heuristics. A system that can automatically extract all this data has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of many business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work.
