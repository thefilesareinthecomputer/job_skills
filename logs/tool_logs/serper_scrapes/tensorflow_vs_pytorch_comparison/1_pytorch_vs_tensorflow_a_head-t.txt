As a result, frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have been created to simplify the creation, serving, and scaling of deep learning models. With the increased interest in deep learning in recent years, there has been an explosion of machine learning tools. In recent years, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Chainer, and others have been introduced and developed at a rapid pace. These frameworks provide neural network units, cost functions, and optimizers to assemble and train neural network models. Using artificial neural networks is an important approach for drawing inferences and making predictions when analyzing large and complex data sets. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular machine learning frameworks supporting ANN models. Trends of paper implementations grouped by framework: Comparison of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow This article describes the effectiveness and differences between these two frameworks based on recent research to compare the training time, memory usage, and ease of use of the two frameworks. In particular, you will learn: Characteristics of PyTorch vs. TensorFlow Performance, Accuracy, Training, and Ease of Use Main Differences PyTorch vs. TensorFlow Complete Comparison Table A neural network trained for small object detection in a traffic analysis application built with Viso Suite Key Characteristics of TensorFlow and PyTorch TensorFlow Overview TensorFlow is a very popular end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team before it was open-sourced. The TensorFlow software library replaced Google’s DistBelief framework and runs on almost all available execution platforms (CPU, GPU, TPU, Mobile, etc.). The framework provides a math library that includes basic arithmetic operators and trigonometric functions. TensorFlow is currently used by various international companies, such as Google, Uber, Microsoft, and a wide range of universities. Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. It provides an approachable, efficient interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning models. The TensorFlow Lite implementation is specially designed for edge-based machine learning. TF Lite is optimized to run various lightweight algorithms on various resource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones, microcontrollers, and other chips. TensorFlow Serving offers a high-performance and flexible system for deploying machine learning models in production settings. One of the easiest ways to get started with TensorFlow Serving is with Docker . For enterprise applications using TensorFlow, check out the computer vision platform Viso Suite which automates the end-to-end infrastructure around serving a TensorFlow model at scale. Real-time computer vision using PyTorch in Construction – built with Viso Suite TensorFlow Advantages Support and library management. TensorFlow is backed by Google and has frequent releases with new features. It is popularly used in production environments. Open-sourced. TensorFlow is an open-source platform that is very popular and available to a broad range of users. Data visualization. TensorFlow provides a tool called TensorBoard to visualize data graphically. It also allows easy debugging of nodes, reduces the effort of looking at the whole code, and effectively resolves the neural network. Keras compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with Keras, which allows its users to code some high-level functionality sections and provides system-specific functionality to TensorFlow (pipelining, estimators, etc.). Very scalable. TensorFlow’s characteristic of being deployed on every machine allows its users to develop any kind of system. Compatibility. TensorFlow is compatible with many languages, such as C++, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and Swift. This allows a user to work in an environment they are comfortable in. Architectural support. TensorFlow finds its use as a hardware acceleration library due to the parallelism of work models. It uses different distribution strategies in GPU and CPU systems. TensorFlow also has its architecture TPU, which performs computations faster than GPU and CPU. Therefore, models built using TPU can be easily deployed on a cloud at a cheaper rate and executed at a faster rate. However, TensorFlow’s architecture TPU only allows the execution of a model, not training it. Real-time object detection using YOLOv7 in an application for smart city and pedestrian detection TensorFlow Disadvantages Benchmark tests. Computation speed is where TensorFlow lags when compared to its competitors. It has less usability in comparison to other frameworks. Dependency. Although TensorFlow reduces the length of code and makes it easier for a user to access it, it adds a level of complexity to its use. Every code needs to be executed using any platform for its support, which increases the dependency for the execution. Symbolic loops. TensorFlow lags at providing the symbolic loops for indefinite sequences. It has its usage for definite sequences, which makes it a usable system. Hence it is referred to as a low-level API. GPU Support. Originally, TensorFlow had only NVIDIA support for GPU and Python support for GPU programming, which is a drawback as there is a hike of other languages in deep learning. TensorFlow Distribution Strategies is a TensorFlow API to distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. Using this API, you can distribute your existing models and training code with minimal code changes. PyTorch Overview PyTorch was first introduced in 2016. Before PyTorch, deep learning frameworks often focused on either speed or usability, but not both. PyTorch has become a popular tool in the deep learning research community by combining a focus on usability with careful performance considerations. It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy, and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. The open source deep learning framework is a Python library that performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current libraries for deep learning. Today, most of its core is written in C++, one of the primary reasons PyTorch can achieve much lower overhead compared to other frameworks. As of today, PyTorch appears to be best suited for drastically shortening the design, training, and testing cycle for new neural networks for specific purposes. Hence it became very popular in the research communities. PyTorch 2.0 PyTorch 2.0 marks a major advancement in the PyTorch framework, offering enhanced performance while maintaining backward compatibility and its Python-centric approach, which has been key to its widespread adoption in the AI/ML community. For mobile deployment, PyTorch provides experimental end-to-end workflow support from Python to iOS and Android platforms, including API extensions for mobile ML integration and preprocessing tasks. PyTorch is suitable for natural language processing ( NLP ) tasks to power intelligent language applications using deep learning. Additionally, PyTorch offers native support for the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, allowing for seamless model export and compatibility with ONNX-compatible platforms and tools. Multiple popular deep learning software and research-oriented projects are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot or Uber’s Pyro. Object and Person Detection in Restaurants with YOLOv8 , built with PyTorch PyTorch Advantages PyTorch is based on Python. PyTorch is Python-centric or “pythonic”, designed for deep integration in Python code instead of being an interface to a deep learning library written in some other language. Python
