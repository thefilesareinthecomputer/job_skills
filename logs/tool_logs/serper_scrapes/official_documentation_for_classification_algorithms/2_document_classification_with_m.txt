If you've ever been to a bookstore, you’ve probably experienced the book-location dilemma. Say you're looking for Atlas Shrugged , and you know it’s a genre mix of science fiction, mystery, and romance. Now, which section will you go to to find it? The science fiction, the romance section? The document classification problem relates to library, information, and computer sciences. It concerns the way we categorize items in databases and inventories. As today’s digital storages can serve large amounts of items, it becomes difficult to categorize them manually. So businesses employ machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for classification tasks. In this article, we’ll explore the essence of document classification, and study the main approaches to categorizing files based on their content. Namely, we’ll look at how rule-based systems and machine learning models work in this context. Additionally, we’ll explain how Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) are applied to document classification. What is document classification? Document classification is a process of assigning categories or classes to documents to make them easier to manage, search, filter, or analyze. A document in this case is an item of information that has content related to some specific category. Product photos, commentaries, invoices, document scans, and emails all can be considered documents. Document classification may be a part of a broader initiative called intelligent document processing (IDP) . Read our separate article on that. Generally, document classification tasks are divided into text and visual classifications. Text classification concerns defining the type, genre, or theme of the text based on its content. Depending on the task, complex techniques like NLP can be used to analyze words and phrases in context and understand their semantics (meaning). For example, NLP is applied in sentiment analysis , where we define the emotion or opinion expressed in the text. Visual classification focuses on a visual structure of documents, employing computer vision and image recognition technologies. Visuals can be represented by motion pictures or still images. Here, we analyze pixels that make up an image, identify the objects pictured, and classify them by their behavior or specific attributes. Document classification real-life use cases Document classification can address various business problems, and some of them are not that evident as classification tasks. Let’s analyze how classification can be implemented and which problems it may help to solve, using real-life examples. Spam detection Analyzing words in context, NLP-based classifiers can define spam phrases and count how often they occur in the text to tell if it’s a spam message. Google’s Gmail spam detector, for instance, employs NLP to find junk messages and drop them into a corresponding folder. In 2015 , Google also implemented a neural network that enhanced the NLP capabilities of their spam filter. Basically, neural networks are applied in case you need more sophisticated technology to detect less obvious spam. Opinion classification and social listening Businesses want to hear what their customers think about them. And one of the most effective ways is to apply sentiment analysis to classify commentaries and reviews on social media by their emotional nature. Sentiment analysis is a narrow case of NLP-based systems that focuses on understanding the emotion, opinion, or attitude expressed through the text. They can extract words that have positive or negative connotations. That’s how we can analyze customer feedback or reactions to your products or services automatically. For example, Gensler , a company that architects airports, implements sentiment analysis to classify feedback travelers place on social media. Opinion mining allows managers to make effective decisions, win contracts, and deliver better services. Customer support ticket classification Customer support agents usually deal with a large volume of requests during the day. An NLP-based system can be implemented for a ticket routing task in this case. Analyzing the text in the message, the system classifies it as “claims,” “refunds,” or “tech support” and sends it to the corresponding department. Vtenext , a CRM provider, uses the Klondike system to analyze the content of a support ticket sent to their IT department. Based on the text provided, their system labels the ticket with a required category like “configuration” or “development.” This significantly improves the speed of ticket processing and partially automates the work of the IT department servicing their CRM. Document scan classification Working with paper-based records presents another challenge within document classification. First, we have to scan them and then extract written or typed text for further analysis. The technology required for these purposes must recognize text and its layout from images and scans, which facilitates turning paper documents into a digital format and then classifying them. For instance, the healthcare industry still deals with paper documents. Digitizing medical reports and other records is one of the critical tasks for medical institutions to optimize their document flow. Because of strict regulations and high accuracy standards, document processing automation becomes complex. But some healthcare organizations like the FDA implement various document classification techniques to process tons of medical archives daily. An example of document structure in healthcare insurance. Source: affine.ai Another example is the insurance industry that processes tens of thousands of claims daily. But it suffers from inefficient workflow since the majority of claims come as scans. It requires extracting raw data from claims automatically and applying NLP for analysis. For example, Wipro , a software vendor, provides an NLP classifier to detect fake claims in the insurance sector. Object recognition with computer vision Object recognition can be applied in business areas that require processing large amounts of visual data to classify them by categories. Mostly, this is a task in inventory management where images depict products that have to be categorized. For example, Scalr developed an image recognition software implemented in Ecommerce that automates product type classification. These are some business cases where document classification can be applied in different forms to give a basic understanding of when it can be used. Now, let’s talk about how document classification works in specific cases, and outline technology choice in more detail. Visual classification with computer vision Computer vision (CV) is an AI technology for recognizing objects on still images or videos. Image recognition can be used in document classification to detect objects, their location, or behavior on the visual content. This provides us with capabilities to categorize photos and videos and apply filtering and search. Computer vision explained There are several classification tasks that computer vision systems can solve. Image classification with localization – identifying an object on the image and marking its location. This technique can be applied to classify scanned documents based on their structure, for example, distinguishing documents that have 5 fields to fill in from those with 3 fields. Object detection – recognizing and labeling multiple objects on the image and showing the location of every object. For example, classifying user-generated visual content. Travel platforms can define images containing restaurant menus, interiors, etc. Object (semantic) segmentation – identifying specific pixels that belong to each object in an image. For instance, detecting disorders on X-ray images and classifying them depending on whether they require a physician's attention. Instance segmentation – differentiating multiple objects of the same class. For instance, naming a breed of a dog, human beings, a kind of tree, etc. This type of classification is not considered a text classification even if it deals with documents because it analyzes the pixel structure of an image and tries to find how text blocks or boxes are situated on the field.

Source: www.sciencedirect.com Image recognition technologies run on deep neural networks – computing systems designed to recognize patterns. In this case, a neural network is trained specifically to analyze pixel patterns that make up an object on the image. Training neural networks and implementing them in your classifier can be a cumbersome task since they require knowledge of deep learning and pretty large datasets. So, for this reason, we can use image recognition APIs that are available on the web. Those APIs ship computer vision capabilities to your software, allowing you to perform visual content classification. You can check our image recognition API list to discover some. Text classification In most cases, classification concerns textual information, since businesses and organizations rely on text documents for everyday operations. There are several scenarios for implementing a classifier. Keep in mind that you can’t classify texts before they’re digitized. So, if you have scanned or physical documents, you need to digitize them first using optical character recognition. Document and text digitization with OCR Document classification may involve physical documents since in industries such as banking , insurance , and healthcare a vast amount of documents are still on paper. Which forces businesses to establish complex workflows to convert handwritten or typed data into a digital format for classification and other tasks. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows for the detection and extraction of text information from s
