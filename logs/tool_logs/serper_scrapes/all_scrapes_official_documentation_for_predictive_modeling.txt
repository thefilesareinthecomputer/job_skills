Learn how machine learning predicts outcomes accurately. By The Pecan Team November 13, 2023 In a nutshell: Predictive modeling combines AI and historical data to make accurate predictions for businesses. It involves defining the problem, preparing data, building models, and integrating findings into workflows. Common types of predictive models include classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection. Algorithms like random forest and linear regression are used to generate predictions. Predictive modeling can be used for marketing mix modeling, customer churn prediction, and supply chain demand forecasting. In the modern data-driven business environment, staying one step ahead of your competitors can make all the difference. Forecasting sales, predicting supply chain issues, and trying to anticipate customer churn are no longer enough. Every business is doing the same thing. So, how do you stand apart? Well, it’s not the quantity of predictions your business makes but the quality that matters, and whether you can take efficient action on them. By leveraging predictive analytics , companies can combine something they’ve always used (like historical data) with new technologies (AI and machine learning models) to make faster and significantly more accurate predictions than ever before. The result? These companies can maximize revenue, reduce costs, and streamline operations to the point where they leave any competitor not leveraging this technology far behind. In this article, we’ll explore the fundamentals of predictive modeling, its benefits to your business, and the specific use cases that make predictive modeling so powerful. What is predictive modeling? Predictive modeling (also known as predictive analytics) is a mathematical technique that combines AI and machine learning with historical data to predict future outcomes accurately. These calculations happen almost instantaneously, allowing businesses to use predictions to make decisions in real time. For example, a business can predict the likelihood of future customers spending a certain amount over a given period based on billions of data points from all current and previous customer interactions. But you can use predictive modeling to predict just about anything. Get started today and let your data drive results in weeks Book a 30min demo ‎ The important thing to remember is that these outcomes are not fixed. Predictive models are regularly revised based on new and changing data. If you change your customer success strategy, the likelihood of customer churn, as calculated by a predictive model, will hopefully decrease. As you may have guessed, predictive modeling can be incredibly powerful and help businesses to make smarter, more profitable decisions. No wonder, then, that the global predictive analytics market is expected to reach $67.66 billion by 2030, up from $14.71 billion in 2023. How does predictive modeling work? The predictive modeling process has three core elements: the datasets, the predictive model, and the algorithm used to make predictions. From there, it’s a five-step process to predictive analytics success : A typical predictive analytics workflow Start by defining the exact problem you want predictive modeling to solve. The more specific and well-defined your goal, the easier it will be to implement a predictive model to achieve it. Second, find as many suitable and high-quality data sources as possible. Then, prepare that data. Every dataset will likely have to be cleaned to make it useful during the modeling process. (Unless, of course, you’re using a platform like Pecan that can handle much of this data preparation process for you.) The penultimate step is building and evaluating models. This can be done from scratch or using a low-code predictive analytics platform. Finally, you’ll need a strategy to integrate your findings from predictive analytics into your workflows. There’s no point in working so hard to source data sets and build models if you aren’t going to use the data to transform business processes, is there? Types of predictive models You don’t need to create a new model for every prediction you want to create. Predictive modeling platforms like Pecan will use one of several models to make forecasts. The most common types of predictive models are: Classification model : Classifies historical data into different categories. It can be used to predict a two-class outcome (such as whether a lead converts or not) or a multi-class outcome (such as whether an email is promotional, personal, important, or spam). Regression model : Uses historical data to predict a continuous variable like customer lifetime value. Clustering model : Groups data by common attributes to predict the future behavior of a specific item or individual. For example, whether a potential new market area fits the attributes of previously successful market areas. Forecast model : A model that estimates a future figure based on historical data, like how many products a store should order next month, for example. Time series model : Uses historical data from a given period as well as other related data sets to predict an outcome over a future given period — for example, sales over the next six months. Anomaly detection model : Predicts whether a behavior or data point is abnormal or considered an outlier. It can be used to predict whether a purchase is fraudulent. Algorithms for predictive models Predictive models use a machine learning algorithm to generate predictions. Some of the most common algorithms include: Random forest predictive modeling : A combination of decision trees that each make their own prediction, performing both classification and regression. Gradient boosted predictive model : A technique that employs a series of related decision trees to generate a prediction. Linear regression : One of the simpler machine learning techniques that simulates the relationship between independent factors and a numerical target response. Logistic regression : A regression model that captures the association among several variables; best suited for scenarios where the target variable has two potential outcomes. Get started today and let your data drive results in weeks Book a 30min demo The benefit of predictive analytics Predictive modeling offers several advantages over traditional forecasting techniques. First, it is far quicker and easier to generate predictive modeling predictions. A predictive analytics platform can now handle much of the low-level manual work associated with making these kinds of predictions. In many cases, these predictions can be generated frequently based on automated data collection and analysis to guide decisions with the most recent information. Predictive models are also tailored to your business. Because the predictions these models generate are based on your company’s proprietary data, they will be much more meaningful and actionable. 3 business use cases for predictive models Several departments across multiple industries actively use predictive modeling to make customer and business-focused predictions and decisions. Marketing mix modeling Predictive modeling can help you better allocate marketing resources across channels to improve your campaigns' impact and ROI. Marketing mix modeling (MMM) has been used for years, but MMM guided by AI and machine learning can generate deeper understanding and actionable information faster. Use it to predict the performance of each channel so you can know which channels will drive the highest revenue and allocate budget accordingly. Take things further by simulating and testing what-if scenarios so you can know how much to spend to generate the highest possible ROAS. Pecan's marketing mix modeling provides insights into marketing ROI. Case in point, a Pecan AI client using MMM identified over $100 million in overspending and generated over $200 million in potential savings. Predicting and reducing customer churn Whatever churn looks like for your business, start getting ahead of your customers by using predictive modeling to intervene quickly. With predictive modeling, success teams can predict churn before it happens and take a proactive approach to retention — increasing customer numbers and boosting lifetime value. Customer success teams can use predictive modeling to prioritize their efforts, allowing budget and resources to be spent as efficiently as possible. You can take things further by using granular details and predictions to personalize prevention-focused customer outreach. Save resources and increase effectiveness by choosing the right customer retention treatments every time. Get started today and let your data drive results in weeks Book a 30min demo Predictive modeling for churn enables proactive responses to retain customers. One Pecan client , for example, used churn-focused predictions to highlight the players who most needed a nudge to return to the game. This allowed them to better target thei

Federal agencies are one of the biggest producers, analyzers, collectors, and distributors of data, ranging from weather forecasts to economic indicators to health statistics​. In an era where data is as valuable as currency, governments worldwide are turning to predictive AI models to anticipate and address the multifaceted needs of the public sector. By integrating predictive AI into government operations, agencies can operate more efficiently, respond more quickly to emerging situations, and serve the public more effectively. For example, predictive AI can: Predict threats or attacks by analyzing global data, enabling proactive defense measures. Anticipate natural disasters, improving emergency preparedness and response strategies Forecast disease outbreaks, helping to allocate resources effectively and save lives. Prevent failures in critical infrastructure like bridges and electrical grids. This blog post delves into the essential elements crucial for developing effective predictive AI models in the public sector. What is Predictive AI? Predictive AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that use data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes or events based on historical and current data. The goal is to go beyond knowing what has happened to provide the best assessment of what will happen in the future. It’s a form of machine learning that helps in making informed decisions by anticipating outcomes. Predictive AI holds immense potential for government agencies, but at the same time, it has inherent challenges for privacy, accountability, and transparency. Bad data, biased algorithms, and interpretability issues can reduce model reliability and fairness. To effectively harness the power of predictive AI in government, it is imperative to consider and address several key aspects. Key Considerations for Building Predictive Models Crafting an effective predictive AI model is an intricate process that demands a strategic blend of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and data acumen. Here are key considerations to ensure the model’s accuracy, relevance, and operational efficiency. Problem Definition and Planning Problem Definition: Clearly define what you want the AI to predict. Understand the problem domain and determine if it’s classification, regression, clustering , or another type of problem. Planning: Design and outline the data collection process, including the sources and types of data needed. Data Preparation and Exploration Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset that is representative of the problem you are trying to solve. Make sure to include various scenarios and consider the diversity of the data. Data Quality and Availability: Implement comprehensive data documentation practices to facilitate understanding and utilization of data assets. Assess the quality of your data. Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and errors. Ensure the data is relevant, unbiased, and usable. Establish data quality initiatives and data governance practices to maintain data accuracy, trust, and reliability. Periodically assess and clean data to minimize errors and inconsistencies. Feature Engineering: Select the most relevant features for your model. Create new features that could improve model performance and remove redundant or irrelevant ones. Ensure all features have a consistent scale. Consider dimensionality reduction while retaining as much information as possible. Leverage domain knowledge to get insights into relevant features that would guide the model development. Model Development and Training Model Selection: Choose the right algorithms based on the problem type, data size, and complexity. You may need to experiment with several models before finding the most suitable one. Train simple baseline models which provide a benchmark for evaluating the performance of more complex models. Training and Testing: Split your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of your model. Use cross-validation to ensure that your model generalizes well. Model Evaluation Evaluation Metrics: Determine the appropriate metrics to measure the performance of your model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under the Curve ( ROC-AUC) for classification, or Mean Squared Error) MSE, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression. Algorithmic Objectivity: Evaluate your model to ensure that it contains accurate and comprehensive data. Overfitting and Underfitting: Be aware of overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. Conversely, underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture underlying patterns. Explainability and Interpretability: Ensure that your model’s predictions are explainable and can be interpreted by stakeholders. The ability to explain a model’s decisions is critical, especially for sensitive applications. Employ explainable AI techniques (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP)) to make model decision-making processes transparent and understandable. Ethical Considerations: Ensure your AI model complies with regulatory and compliance standards. Implement regular audits and mitigation strategies to address the risk of inaccurate predictions. Scalability and Efficiency: Consider if your model can scale to handle larger datasets or s

See the Libraries’ guide to Alternative Sources for Federal Information and Data . AI and Machine Learning for Evidence Syntheses: Predictive AI/ML Tools Available at UNC Created by Health Science Librarians Ask HSL What are artificial intelligence and machine learning? Predictive AI/ML Tools Available at UNC Types of AI/ML Unsupervised Machine Learning Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Supervised Machine Learning Active Machine Learning How You Can Partner with the HSL Generative AI & Other Tools Best Practices & Guidelines Types of AI/ML Artificial Intelligence versus Machine Learning Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to any situation where a machine functions to copy human intelligence. This is a broad category, and includes things such as virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and facial-recognition technology. Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence where the machine is given data to learn how to complete certain tasks. Predictive AI versus Generative AI The UNC Health Sciences Library (HSL) has a set of internal tools that can be applied to systematic reviews and other large scale evidence-syntheses to prioritize citations for screening. These tools use predictive AI models rather than generative AI. Application of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) to article screening is evolving rapidly. Currently, there are no commercial products available that use GenAI to categorize citations as relevant or not relevant. Machine learning approaches (predictive AI) used by HSL are available to prioritize citations for screening. This guide will be updated when resources and tested approaches become available. Generative AI tools take in large amounts of training data to learn how to produce or generate content on their own. ChatGPT (text generation) and DALL-E (image generation) are examples of generative AI tools. In contrast, predictive AI uses labeled data (i.e. categorized by humans) to make predictions about future outcomes. Predictive AI is well-established and has been used often in various fields such as weather forecasting and finance. While predictive AI models have been used for decades, they have not been adopted on a large scale for systematic reviews or literature-based research. With the growing amount of published research, it is likely that AI will become an integral part of the research process. Predictive AI models can be effectively used to prioritize citations for human review. Extensive testing of the methodology particularly for biomedical literature can be found in peer-reviewed studies dating back to 2000 (Mostafa & Lam, 2000) . Element Predictive AI Generative AI Input Based on labeled data (i.e., categorized manually by humans) Large language model (LLM) and user prompts Output Predictions for unlabeled data (e.g., indicates citations likely to be relevant) New content Reproducible Yes No Validated Algorithms Available Yes No Training Data is Transparent Yes No Some of the information presented in the table above is adapted from Dr. Siw Waffenschmidt's presentation titled "Could large language models and/or AI-based automation tools assist the screening process?". This presentation was sponsored by Cochrane and more information can be found at https://training.cochrane.org/resource/could-large-language-models-and-or-ai-based-automation-tools-assist-the-screening-process . Generative AI vs Predictive AI This YouTube video explains the key characteristics of generative AI compared to predictive AI, and provides examples (10 minutes). Generative AI vs. predictive AI: What’s the difference? This IBM blog post explains the differences between generative AI and predictive AI. Predictive AI for Systematic Reviews There are four types of predictive AI/ML that have applications for systematic reviews including: 1.) unsupervised machine learning (clustering), 2.) semi-supervised machine learning , 3.) supervised machine learning , and 4.) active machine learning . Generally speaking, these approaches work best on projects with 3,000 or more unique citations, although, clustering may be used for topic analysis on smaller datasets. You can find more information about each of these approaches on this page. Unsupervised Machine Learning What is unsupervised machine learning (clustering)? Unsupervised machine learning, or clustering, uses algorithms such as k-means , Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) , or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) .​ ​At HSL, we primarily use k-means clustering which groups data into a fixed number (k) of clusters based on text similarities in titles and abstracts. Citations from a literature search, most commonly using titles and abstracts, are run through k-means clustering, which creates groups, or clusters, based on words commonly featured in each. Researchers can view the keywords that were used to develop the cluster, use them to see the distribution of literature within the search results, and help define or narrow a literature search topic. Input List of citations, including titles and abstracts for each. These data are unlabeled, meaning the user does not assign relevance to any of the input citations. Output Clusters of citations with keyword summaries for each cluster. In the image above, each shape represents one article. Unlabeled titles and abstracts are input, and clusters of articles based on text similarities of input data. Benefits of Clustering Does not require developing a set of seed studies (also called labeled or training data) Provides insight into themes appearing withing the entire corpus Quick and simple Data-driven approach Good for refining the literature search of large or complex reviews Limitations of Clustering Relies on human judgment to prioritize clusters for screening, which requires subject matter expertise No prediction of the number of relevant studies in the search Reduced precision as clusters are not based on seeds or a training set Example of Clustering Output from a Systematic Review Search In the example below, titles and abstracts of all citations from a large systematic review literature search were analyzed using clustering. Each citation is assigned to one of ten groups based on text analysis. The output from clustering is shown below. Keywords for each cluster are generated by the algorithm and can provide insight into topics found in the corpus. Subject matter experts may use the keywords to look closer at citations in a particular cluster.

Semi-supervised machine learning also uses clustering algorithms. UNC refers to this methodology as supervised clustering. The method is considered semi-supervised because a portion of the studies sent to clustering have been manually reviewed for relevance. These manually reviewed studies, also called seeds, are typically known relevant studies. The seeds are clustered along with unlabeled data and can provide another signal (beyond the keywords generated by the algorithm) as to which clusters are likely to contain studies o
