Neptune Blog How to Build ETL Data Pipeline in ML Natasha Sharma 7 min 19th May, 2023 General From data processing to quick insights, robust pipelines are a must for any ML system. Often the Data Team, comprising Data and ML Engineers , needs to build this infrastructure, and this experience can be painful. However, efficient use of ETL pipelines in ML can help make their life much easier. This article explores the importance of ETL pipelines in machine learning, a hands-on example of building ETL pipelines with a popular tool, and suggests the best ways for data engineers to enhance and sustain their pipelines. We also discuss different types of ETL pipelines for ML use cases and provide real-world examples of their use to help data engineers choose the right one. Before delving into the technical details, let’s review some fundamental concepts. What is an ETL data pipeline in ML? An ETL data pipeline is a collection of tools and activities to perform Extract(E), Transform(T), and Load(L) for the required data. ETL pipeline | Source: Author These activities involve extracting data from one system, transforming it, and then processing it into another target system where it can be stored and managed. ML heavily relies on ETL pipelines as the accuracy and effectiveness of a model are directly impacted by the quality of the training data. These pipelines assist data scientists in saving time and effort by ensuring that the data is clean, properly formatted, and ready for use in machine learning tasks. Moreover, ETL pipelines play a crucial role in breaking down data silos and establishing a single source of truth. Let’s look at the importance of ETL pipelines in detail. Why do we need an ETL pipeline in machine learning? The significance of ETL pipelines lies in the fact that they enable organizations to derive valuable insights from large and complex data sets. Here are some specific reasons why they are important: Data Integration: Organizations can integrate data from various sources using ETL pipelines. This provides data scientists with a unified view of the data and helps them decide how the model should be trained, values for hyperparameters, etc. Data Quality Check: As the data flows through the integration step, ETL pipelines can then help improve the quality of data by standardizing, cleaning, and validating it. This ensures that the data which will be used for ML is accurate, reliable, and consistent. Save Time: As ETL pipelines automate the process of 3 major steps – Extract, Transform, and Load, this helps in saving a lot of time and also reduces the likelihood of human errors. This allows data scientists to keep their focus on the creation of models or their continuous improvement. Scalable: Modern ETL pipelines are scalable, i.e., they can be scaled up or down depending on the amount of data it needs to process. Basically, it comes with the flexibility and agility to make any changes based on business needs.

Data pipeline is an umbrella term for the category of moving data between different systems, and ETL data pipeline is a type of data pipeline. — Xoriant It is common to use ETL data pipeline and data pipeline interchangeably. Even though both these terms refer to functionalities and processes of passing data from various sources to a single repository, they are not the same. Let’s explore why we should not be using them synonymously. Comparisons ETL Pipeline Data Pipeline Terminology As the abbreviation suggests, ETL involves a series of processes, extracting the data, transforming it and at the end loading it to the target source. A data pipeline also involves moving data from one source to another but doesn’t necessarily have to go through data transformation. Focus Area ETL helps to transform the raw data into a structured format that can be easily available for data scientists to create models and interpret for any data-driven decision. A data pipeline is created with the focus of transferring data from a variety of sources into a data warehouse. Further processes or workflows can then easily utilize this data to create business intelligence and analytics solutions. Operation ETL pipeline runs on schedule e.g. daily, weekly or monthly. Basic ETL pipelines are batch-oriented, where data is moved in chunks on a specified schedule. Data pipelines often run real-time processing. Data gets updated continuously and supports real-time reporting and analysis. In summary, ETL pipelines are a type of data pipeline that is specifically designed for extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a common format, and loading it into a data warehouse or other storage system. While a data pipeline can include various types of pipelines, ETL pipeline is one specific subset of a data pipeline. We went through the basic architecture of an ETL pipeline and saw how each step can be performed for different purposes, and we can choose from various tools to complete each step. The ELT architecture and its type differ from organization to organization as they have different sets of tech stack, data sources, and business requirements. What are the different types of ETL pipelines in ML? ETL pipelines can be categorized based on the type of data being processed and how it is being processed. Here are some of the types: Batch ETL Pipeline: This is a traditional ETL approach that involves the processing of large amounts of data at once in batches. The data is extracted from one or more sources, transformed into the desired format, and loaded into a target system, such as a data warehouse. Batch ETL is particularly useful for training models on historical data or running periodic batch processing jobs. Real-time ETL Pipeline: This processes data as it arrives in near-real-time or real-time; processing data continuously means a smaller amount of processing capacity is required at any one time, and spikes in usage can be avoided. Stream/ Real-time ETL is particularly useful for applications such as fraud detection, where real-time processing is critical. The real-time ETL pipelines require tools and technologies like stream processing engines and messaging systems. Incremental ETL Pipeline: These pipelines only extract and process data that has changed since the last run instead of processing the entire dataset. They are useful for situations where the source data changes frequently, but the target system only needs the latest data e.g. applications such as recommendation systems, where the data changes frequently but not in real-time. Cloud ETL Pipeline: Cloud ETL pipeline for ML involves using cloud-based services to extract, transform, and load data into an ML system for training and deployment. Cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP offer a range of tools and services that can be used to build these pipelines. For example, AWS provides services such as AWS Glue for ETL, Amazon S3 for data storage, and Amazon SageMaker for ML training and deployment. Hybrid ETL Pipeline: These pipelines combine batch and real-time processing, leveraging the strengths of both approaches. Hybrid ETL pipelines can process large batches of data at predetermined intervals and also capture real-time updates to the data as they arrive. Hybrid ETL is particularly useful for applications such as predictive maintenance, where a combination of real-time and historical data is needed to train models. ETL pipeline tools To create an ETL pipeline, as discussed in the last section, we require tools, tools that can provide us the functionality of following basic ETL architecture steps. There are several tools available in the market, here are some of the popular ones, along with the features they provide. Tool Cloudbased Pre-Built Connectors Serverless Pre-Built Transformation Options API Support Fully Managed Hevo Data AWS Glue GCP Cloud Data Fusion Apache Spark Talend Apache Airflow You may also like Comparing Tools For Data Processing Pipelines How to build an ML ETL pipeline? In the previous section, we briefly explored some basic ETL concepts and tools, in this section, we will be discussing how we can leverage them to build an ETL pipeline. First, let’s talk about its architecture. ETL architecture The distinctive feature of the ETL architecture is that data goes through all required preparation procedures before it reaches the warehouse. As a result, the final repository contains clean, complete, and trustworthy data to be used further without amendments. — Coupler ETL architecture often includes a diagram like the one above that outlines the flow of information in the ETL pipeline from data sources to the final destination. It comprises three main areas: Landing area, Staging area, and Data Warehouse area. The Landing Area is the first destination for data after being extracted from the source location. It can store multiple batches of data before moving it through the ETL pipeline. The Staging Area is an intermediate location for performing ETL transformations. The Data Warehouse Area is the final destination for data in an ETL pipeline. It is used for analyzing data to obtain valuable insights and make better business decisions. ETL data pipeline architecture is layered. Each subsystem is essential, and sequentially, each sub-system feeds into the next until data reaches its destination. ETL data pipeline architecture | Source: Author Data Discovery: Data can be sourced from various types of systems, such as databases, file systems, APIs, or streaming sources. We also need data profiling i.e. data discovery, to understand if the data is appropriate for ETL. This involves looking at the data structure, relationships, and content. Ingestion: You can pull the data from the various data sources into a staging area or data lake. Extraction can be done using various techniques such as AP
