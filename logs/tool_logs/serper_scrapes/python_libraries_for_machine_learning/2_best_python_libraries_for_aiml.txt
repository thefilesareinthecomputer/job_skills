Discussion Hey folks, My colleague Nicolas Azevedo just wrote a pretty comprehensive article about Python libraries for AI and Machine Learning. It covers a bunch of stuff from basic data wrangling with Pandas and NumPy to the heavy hitters like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I thought it was a solid overview, especially how it breaks down when you might use one library over another. Like, when you'd reach for TensorFlow vs PyTorch, that kind of thing. Anyway, I'm curious: What's your favorite Python library for AI/ML stuff? Any libraries you think don't get enough love?
