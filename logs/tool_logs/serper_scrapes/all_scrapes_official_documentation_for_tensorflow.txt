TensorFlow API TensorFlow v2.16.1 API Documentation Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. TensorFlow has APIs available in several languages both for constructing and executing a TensorFlow graph. The Python API is at present the most complete and the easiest to use, but other language APIs may be easier to integrate into projects and may offer some performance advantages in graph execution. A word of caution: the APIs in languages other than Python are not yet covered by the API stability promises . Python JavaScript C++ Java We encourage the community to develop and maintain support for other languages with the approach recommended by the TensorFlow maintainers . For example, see the bindings for: C#: TensorFlowSharp and TensorFlow.NET , Haskell , Julia , MATLAB , R , Ruby , Rust , Scala , and Perl . We also provide the C++ API reference for TensorFlow Serving: TensorFlow Serving There are also some archived or unsupported language bindings: Go

TensorFlow Ecosystem Learn ML Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. Master your path To become an expert in machine learning, you first need a strong foundation in four learning areas : coding, math, ML theory, and how to build your own ML project from start to finish. Begin with TensorFlow's curated curriculums to improve these four skills, or choose your own learning path by exploring our resource library below. The four areas of machine learning education When beginning your educational path, it's important to first understand how to learn ML.
