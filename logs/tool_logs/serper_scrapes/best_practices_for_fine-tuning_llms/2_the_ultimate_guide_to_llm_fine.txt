Companies are now incorporating LLMs into their tech stack, using models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cohere to power their applications. This surge in popularity has created a demand for fine-tuning foundation models on specific data sets to ensure accuracy. Businesses can adapt pre-trained language models to their unique needs using fine tuning techniques and general training data. This has led to the rise of Generative AI and companies like OpenAI. The ability to fine tune LLMs has opened up a world of possibilities for businesses looking to harness the power of AI. Hereâs what weâll cover: What is LLM fine tuning? How does fine tuning LLMs work? How to choose the best pre-trained model for fine-tuning? Large Language Models fine-tuning methods Challenges & limitations of LLM fine tuning Understanding LLM fine tuning: Resources & tools Now, letâs get started. Even perfectly fine-tuned models can be exploited.

In the context of "LLM Fine-Tuning," LLM refers to a "Large Language Model" like the GPT series from OpenAI. This method is important because training a large language model from scratch is incredibly expensive, both in terms of computational resources and time. By leveraging the knowledge already captured in the pre-trained model, one can achieve high performance on specific tasks with significantly less data and compute. When do we need to fine tune models Fine-tuning models is crucial in machine learning when you want to adapt a pre-existing model to a specific task or domain. The decision to fine tune a model depends on your objectives, which are often domain or task-specific. Here are some key scenarios when you should consider fine-tuning: Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning is a key component of transfer learning, where a pre-trained model's knowledge is transferred to a new task. Instead of training a large model from scratch, you can start with a pre-trained model and fine tune it on your specific task. This accelerates the training process and allows the model to leverage its general language understanding for the new task. Limited Data Availability: Fine-tuning is particularly beneficial when you have limited labeled data for your specific task. Instead of training a model from scratch, you can leverage a pre-trained model's knowledge and adapt it to your task using a smaller dataset. Time and Resource Efficiency: Training a deep learning model from scratch requires substantial computational resources and time. Fine-tuning on top of a pre-trained model is often more efficient, as you can skip the initial training stages and converge faster to a solution. Task-Specific Adaptation: Fine-tuning is necessary when you have a pre-trained language model, and you want to adapt it to perform a specific task. For example, you might fine tune a language model for sentiment analysis or text generation for a particular domain like medical or legal documents using domain specific data. Continuous Learning: Fine-tuning is useful for continuous learning scenarios where the model needs to adapt to changing data and requirements over time. It allows you to periodically update the model without starting from scratch. Bias Mitigation: If you're concerned about biases present in a pre-trained model, fine-tuning can be used to reduce or counteract those biases by providing balanced and rep
