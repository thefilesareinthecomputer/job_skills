If you've ever been to a bookstore, you’ve probably experienced the book-location dilemma. Say you're looking for Atlas Shrugged , and you know it’s a genre mix of science fiction, mystery, and romance. Now, which section will you go to to find it? The science fiction, the romance section? The document classification problem relates to library, information, and computer sciences. It concerns the way we categorize items in databases and inventories. As today’s digital storages can serve large amounts of items, it becomes difficult to categorize them manually. So businesses employ machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for classification tasks. In this article, we’ll explore the essence of document classification, and study the main approaches to categorizing files based on their content. Namely, we’ll look at how rule-based systems and machine learning models work in this context. Additionally, we’ll explain how Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) are applied to document classification. What is document classification? Document classification is a process of assigning categories or classes to documents to make them easier to manage, search, filter, or analyze. A document in this case is an item of information that has content related to some specific category. Product photos, commentaries, invoices, document scans, and emails all can be considered documents. Document classification may be a part of a broader initiative called intelligent document processing (IDP) . Read our separate article on that. Generally, document classification tasks are divided into text and visual classifications. Text classification concerns defining the type, genre, or theme of the text based on its content. Depending on the task, complex techniques like NLP can be used to analyze words and phrases in context and understand their semantics (meaning). For example, NLP is applied in sentiment analysis , where we define the emotion or opinion expressed in the text. Visual classification focuses on a visual structure of documents, employing computer vision and image recognition technologies. Visuals can be represented by motion pictures or still images. Here, we analyze pixels that make up an image, identify the objects pictured, and classify them by their behavior or specific attributes. Document classification real-life use cases Document classification can address various business problems, and some of them are not that evident as classification tasks. Let’s analyze how classification can be implemented and which problems it may help to solve, using real-life examples. Spam detection Analyzing words in context, NLP-based classifiers can define spam phrases and count how often they occur in the text to tell if it’s a spam message. Google’s Gmail spam detector, for instance, employs NLP to find junk messages and drop them into a corresponding folder. In 2015 , Google also implemented a neural network that enhanced the NLP capabilities of their spam filter. Basically, neural networks are applied in case you need more sophisticated technology to detect less obvious spam. Opinion classification and social listening Businesses want to hear what their customers think about them. And one of the most effective ways is to apply sentiment analysis to classify commentaries and reviews on social media by their emotional nature. Sentiment analysis is a narrow case of NLP-based systems that focuses on understanding the emotion, opinion, or attitude expressed through the text. They can extract words that have positive or negative connotations. That’s how we can analyze customer feedback or reactions to your products or services automatically. For example, Gensler , a company that architects airports, implements sentiment analysis to classify feedback travelers place on social media. Opinion mining allows managers to make effective decisions, win contracts, and deliver better services. Customer support ticket classification Customer support agents usually deal with a large volume of requests during the day. An NLP-based system can be implemented for a ticket routing task in this case. Analyzing the text in the message, the system classifies it as “claims,” “refunds,” or “tech support” and sends it to the corresponding department. Vtenext , a CRM provider, uses the Klondike system to analyze the content of a support ticket sent to their IT department. Based on the text provided, their system labels the ticket with a required category like “configuration” or “development.” This significantly improves the speed of ticket processing and partially automates the work of the IT department servicing their CRM. Document scan classification Working with paper-based records presents another challenge within document classification. First, we have to scan them and then extract written or typed text for further analysis. The technology required for these purposes must recognize text and its layout from images and scans, which facilitates turning paper documents into a digital format and then classifying them. For instance, the healthcare industry still deals with paper documents. Digitizing medical reports and other records is one of the critical tasks for medical institutions to optimize their document flow. Because of strict regulations and high accuracy standards, document processing automation becomes complex. But some healthcare organizations like the FDA implement various document classification techniques to process tons of medical archives daily. An example of document structure in healthcare insurance. Source: affine.ai Another example is the insurance industry that processes tens of thousands of claims daily. But it suffers from inefficient workflow since the majority of claims come as scans. It requires extracting raw data from claims automatically and applying NLP for analysis. For example, Wipro , a software vendor, provides an NLP classifier to detect fake claims in the insurance sector. Object recognition with computer vision Object recognition can be applied in business areas that require processing large amounts of visual data to classify them by categories. Mostly, this is a task in inventory management where images depict products that have to be categorized. For example, Scalr developed an image recognition software implemented in Ecommerce that automates product type classification. These are some business cases where document classification can be applied in different forms to give a basic understanding of when it can be used. Now, let’s talk about how document classification works in specific cases, and outline technology choice in more detail. Visual classification with computer vision Computer vision (CV) is an AI technology for recognizing objects on still images or videos. Image recognition can be used in document classification to detect objects, their location, or behavior on the visual content. This provides us with capabilities to categorize photos and videos and apply filtering and search. Computer vision explained There are several classification tasks that computer vision systems can solve. Image classification with localization – identifying an object on the image and marking its location. This technique can be applied to classify scanned documents based on their structure, for example, distinguishing documents that have 5 fields to fill in from those with 3 fields. Object detection – recognizing and labeling multiple objects on the image and showing the location of every object. For example, classifying user-generated visual content. Travel platforms can define images containing restaurant menus, interiors, etc. Object (semantic) segmentation – identifying specific pixels that belong to each object in an image. For instance, detecting disorders on X-ray images and classifying them depending on whether they require a physician's attention. Instance segmentation – differentiating multiple objects of the same class. For instance, naming a breed of a dog, human beings, a kind of tree, etc. This type of classification is not considered a text classification even if it deals with documents because it analyzes the pixel structure of an image and tries to find how text blocks or boxes are situated on the field. An example of computer vision classification for recognizing different elements of the document. Source: www.sciencedirect.com Image recognition technologies run on deep neural networks – computing systems designed to recognize patterns. In this case, a neural network is trained specifically to analyze pixel patterns that make up an object on the image. Training neural networks and implementing them in your classifier can be a cumbersome task since they require knowledge of deep learning and pretty large datasets. So, for this reason, we can use image recognition APIs that are available on the web. Those APIs ship computer vision capabilities to your software, allowing you to perform visual content classification. You can check our image recognition API list to discover some. Text classification In most cases, classification concerns textual information, since businesses and organizations rely on text documents for everyday operations. There are several scenarios for implementing a classifier. Keep in mind that you can’t classify texts before they’re digitized. So, if you have scanned or physical documents, you need to digitize them first using optical character recognition. Document and text digitization with OCR Document classification may involve physical documents since in industries such as banking , insurance , and healthcare a vast amount of documents are still on paper. Which forces businesses to establish complex workflows to convert handwritten or typed data into a digital format for classification and other tasks. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows for the detection and extraction of text information from s

Download Thank you! Your submission has been received! Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form. Document classification is a crucial step in managing modern data. It is fundamental for every organization to organize, process, and retrieve its data on a large scale. Algorithms have replaced manual classification. They make the task scale better and cost less. The early process of document classification involved humans labeling documents. This process was time-consuming and error-prone. As computers became more common, rule-based systems became important. They used manually defined keywords. However, their scaling problems persisted. Document classification has experienced a significant breakthrough, all thanks to the emergence of AI and ML technologies. These technologies enable computers to learn from data. They identify patterns and generalize from what they have been trained on, thus generating faster, more accurate, and more scalable classification processes.Â Understanding Document Classification Document classification assigns a document to one or more pre-defined categories based on its content. This is crucial to identifying the right category for a document based on the features of its text, image, or whatever else it might contain.Â This way of organizing information helps us find information. It does this by aiding storage, search, and document management. Key Benefits of Implementing Document Classification Systems Take a look at some of the benefits: Improved Efficiency and Productivity : Automated classification fastens the process of organizing and retrieving documents, reducing the time you would spend on manual sorting and searching. Enhanced Searchability and Retrieval: By categorizing documents into specific classes, it becomes easier to locate relevant information quickly, improving overall access and usability. Better Data Management : Classification systems help in systematically managing large volumes of documents, ensuring that data is organized logically and consistently. Regulatory Compliance : Proper classification aids in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements by ensuring that documents are categorized and stored in accordance with prescribed standards Cost Savings : Reducing the need for manual intervention in document management cuts labor costs and minimizes errors, leading to cost savings for the organization. Different Types of Document Classification Document classification is the process of automatically assigning documents to pre-determined categories. It is important in many fields. Here, we explore two prominent types of document classification:Â 1. Text Classification Text classification assigns one or more predefined category names to each document in the input text collection. It is used in email filtering, sentiment analysis, news categorization, and spam filtering. Some examples of text classification techniques are: Text classifiers use supervised learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models. These algorithms include RNNs and Transformers. They learn from labeled training data how to classify new, unseen text. Feature Extraction: Text becomes a number 'feature vector'. It is given to a machine learning model. This is done using techniques like BoW (Bag-of-Words), TF-IDF (Term Frequency x Inverse Document Frequency), word-embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe), or BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). Text classification has many applications. It is used in customer support automation. It is also used for content recommendation, legal document classification, and content moderation on social media. 2. Image Classification Image classification assigns an image a label or category based on its visual content. It has a wide range of applications, including medicinal imaging, autonomous driving vehicles, satellite monitoring, and object identification in surveillance systems.Â Major characteristics of image classification include: CNNs are deep learning models. They are trained to work with visual data. A model with many layers can automatically detect more complex features in images by using convolutional and pooling layers, and then fully connected layers. Transfer learning is when pre-trained CNN models start by training on large image datasets, like the popular ImageNet, which has over 14 million images of real things. The models are then re-trained for smaller classification tasks. This process lets the models 'jump ahead', train faster, and become more accurate. Image classification is the basis of real-world applications. It's used in face recognition, object recognition, medical image analysis (disease detection), manufacturing quality control, and environmental monitoring.Â 3. Automated Document Classification Automated document classification uses AI and ML algorithms. These systems analyse documents and group them into predefined categories. With enough labeled data, these systems can learn patterns and predict what categories new documents should be placed in.Â Automating the document classification process eliminates human errors and makes processing many documents more efficient. Machine learning is at the core of Automated Document Classification. It allows systems to learn from examples or labeled data. Document Classification Machine Learning use this learning to predict labels for new documents that have never been classified.Â Some important contributions of Document Classification Machine Learning are: ML algorithms can detect patterns and math in text data. These patterns signal separation into document categories. Scalability is key. An ML model can handle many documents quickly. This would be impossible for experts to do by hand. ML models can improve their predictions with new data. They can use it to refine class boundaries. Document Classification Machine Learning algorithms learn to recognize documents. They do this by training on a dataset where documents are labelled with categories: Raw documents are first tokenized. Then, they are de-stopped and stemmed/lemmatized (depending on the chosen language). This makes the unstructured text ready for ML models. Feature Extraction breaks text into features. It uses methods like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings. The data is processed (after cleaning) and used to create an ML model. The model is trained to detect patterns in the data linked to category. Inspect the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You need to tune it by adjusting parameters. Also, by improving feature extraction or trying different models. You must do this until performance is acceptably good. Manual document classification involves a human operator categorizing each document after close inspection. This process is error-prone, labor-intensive, and time-consuming, especially when handling large and numerous documents.Â Automatic document categorisation involves using machine learning to analyse and categorize documents.Â This kind of sorting saves time. It scales

In this age of rapid technological advancement, most people are familiar with AI. We’ve likely all read the articles about automation destroying jobs, or a future of robots taking over the world. While those articles are more based on science fiction than a tangible future of AI, it certainly keeps interest in AI top-of-mind for many people. There are dozens of examples of AI that everyday consumers may use, such as facial recognition, auto-correct, search engines, or social media algorithms. But have you ever wondered how these programs work? AI runs off of algorithms, but not all AI algorithms are the same. They’re developed with different goals and methods. In this article, we’ll talk about the four major categories of AI algorithms and how they all work. In this article, we’ll cover: What is artificial intelligence? What is an AI algorithm? How do AI algorithms work? Types of AI algorithms Supervised learning Unsupervised learning Both supervised and unsupervised learning Reinforcement learning Uses of AI algorithms AI algorithms and business What is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science concerned with creating machines that can think and make decisions independently of human intervention. Those AI programs can do complex tasks that were previously only able to be done by humans. Some AI programs can complete simple tasks, some more complex. Some can take in data to learn and improve, completely without the touch of a human developer. Learn more about artificial intelligence . What is an AI algorithm? So then what is an AI algorithm? The definition of an algorithm is “a set of instructions to be followed in calculations or other operations.” This applies to both mathematics and computer science. So, at the essential level, an AI algorithm is the programming that tells the computer how to learn to operate on its own. An AI algorithm is much more complex than what most people learn about in algebra, of course. A complex set of rules drive AI programs, determining their steps and their ability to learn. Without an algorithm, AI wouldn’t exist. How do AI algorithms work? While a general algorithm can be simple, AI algorithms are by nature more complex. AI algorithms work by taking in training data that helps the algorithm to learn. How that data is acquired and is labeled marks the key difference between different types of AI algorithms. At the core level, an AI algorithm takes in training data (labeled or unlabeled, supplied by developers, or acquired by the program itself) and uses that information to learn and grow. Then it completes its tasks, using the training data as a basis. Some types of AI algorithms can be taught to learn on their own and take in new data to change and refine their process. Others will need the intervention of a programmer in order to streamline. Types of artificial intelligence algorithms There are three major categories of AI algorithms: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The key differences between these algorithms are in how they’re trained, and how they function. Under those categories, there are dozens of different algorithms. We’ll be talking about the most popular and commonly used from each category, as well as where they are commonly used. Supervised learning algorithms The first, and most commonly used category of algorithms is “Supervised learning.” These work by taking in clearly-labeled data while being trained and using that to learn and grow. It uses the labeled data to predict outcomes for other data. The name “supervised learning” comes from the comparison of a student learning in the presence of a teacher or expert. Building a supervised learning algorithm that actually works takes a team of dedicated experts to evaluate and review the results, not to mention data scientists to test the models the algorithm creates to ensure their accuracy against the original data, and catch any errors from the AI. Definitions: Classification and Regression Below, we jump into explaining the different types of supervised learning algorithms. All of them can either be used for classification or regression, or both. Classification means an either/or result using binary (0 = no, 1 = yes). So the algorithm will classify something as either one or another, but never both. There is also multi-class classification , which deals with organizing data into defined categories or types relevant to a specific need. Regression means the result will end with a real number (either round or a decimal point). You usually have a dependent variable and an independent variable, and the algorithm will use both points to estimate a possible other result (either forecast or generalized estimate). Decision Tree One of the most common supervised learning algorithms, decision trees get their name because of their tree-like structure (even though the tree is inverted). The “roots” of the tree are the training datasets and they lead to specific nodes which denote a test attribute. Nodes often lead to other nodes, and a node that doesn’t lead onward is called a “leaf”. Decision trees classify all the data into decision nodes. It uses a selection criteria called Attribute Selection Measures (ASM) which takes into account various measures (some examples would be entropy, gain ratio, information gain, etc). Using the root data and following the ASM, the decision tree can classify the data it is given by following the training data into sub-nodes until it reaches the conclusion. Random Forest The random forest algorithm is actually a broad collection of different decision trees, leading to its name. The random forest builds different decision trees and connects them to gain more accurate results. These can be used for both classification and regression. Support Vector Machines The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is another common AI algorithm that can be used for either classification or regression (but is most often used for classification). SVM works by plotting each piece of data on a chart (in N dimensional space where N = the number of datapoints). Then, the algorithm classifies the datapoints by finding the hyperplace that separates each class. There can be more than one hyperplane. Naive Bayes The reason this algorithm is called “Naive Bayes” is that it’s based on Bayes’ Theorem, and also relies heavily on a large assumption: that the presence of one particular feature is unrelated to the presence of other features in the same class. That major assumption is the “naive” aspect of the name. Naive Bayes is useful for large datasets with many different classes. It, like many other supervised learning algorithms, is a classification algorithm. Linear regression Linear regression is a supervised learning AI algorithm used for regression modeling. It’s mostly used for discovering the relationship between data points, predictions, and forecasting. Much like SVM, it works by plotting pieces of data on a chart with the X-axis is the independent variable and the Y-axis is the dependent variable. The data points are then plotted out in a linear fashion to determine their relationship and forecast possible future data. Logistic regression A logistic regression algorithm usually uses a binary value (0/1) to estimate values from a set of independent variables. The output of logistic regression is either 1 or 0, yes or no. An example of this would be a spam filter in email. The filter uses logistic regression to mark whether an incoming email is spam (0) or not (1). Logistic regression is only useful when the dependent variable is categorical, either yes or no. Create beautiful visualizations with your data. Try Tableau for free Unsupervised learning algorithms It may at this point be relatively easy to guess what unsupervised learning algorithms mean, in comparison to supervised learning. Unsupervised learning algorithms are given data that isn’t labeled. Unsupervised learning algorithms use that unlabeled data to create models and evaluate the relationships between different data points in order to give more insight to the data. Definition: Clustering Many unsupervised learning algorithms perform the function of clustering, which means they sort the unlabeled data points into pre-defined clusters. The goal is to have each data point belong to only one cluster, with no overlap. There can be more than one data point in any given cluster, but a data point cannot belong to more than one cluster. K-means clustering K-means is an algorithm designed to perform the clustering function in unsupervised learning. It does this by taking in the pre-determined clusters and plotting out all the data regardless of the cluster. It then plots a randomly-selected piece of data as the centroid for each cluster (think of it as a circle around each cluster, with that piece of data as the exact center point). From there, it sorts the remaining data points into clusters based on their proximity to each other and the centroid data point for each cluster. Gaussian mixture model Gaussian mixture models are similar to K-means clustering in many ways. Both are concerned with sorting data into pre-determined clusters based on proximity. However, Gaussian models are a little more versatile in the shapes of the clusters they allow. Picture a graph with all your data points plotted out. K-means clustering only allows data to be clustered in circles with the centroid in the center of each cluster. Gaussian mixture can handle data that lands on the graph in more linear patterns, allowing for oblong-shaped clusters. This allows for greater clarity in clustering if one datapoint lands inside the circle of another cluster. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms Some AI algorithms can use either supervised or unsupervised data input and still function. They might have slightly different applications based on their status. K-nearest neighbor algorithm K-nearest neigh
