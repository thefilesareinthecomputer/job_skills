Become an AI Engineer with 365 Data Science FAQs Methodology We analyzed 903 job postings from Glassdoor US to help you get a better understanding of the AI engineer job market in 2025. After cleaning and removing duplicates, we extracted key AI engineering keywords and requirements from each listing. This comprehensive analysis reveals current job responsibilities, skill requirements, and industry trends. To make our findings clear and comparable, we've presented all data as percentages and created visual representations that highlight the most important trends. What do AI Engineers Do? Throughout our years of job market research, we've observed a trend in data and AI-related jobs. Companies are shifting away from hiring specialists who focus on single data tasks, increasingly preferring professionals who can manage data end-to-end and combine multiple skill sets. To quantify this shift, we've developed our Job Posting Specialization Score (JPSS). But before we get into that, let's look at the accepted AI engineer job description. AI Engineer Job Description AI engineers design, build, and maintain artificial intelligence systems. They bridge theoretical machine learning concepts and practical AI applications, creating solutions that can understand, learn, and make decisions. In 2025, AI engineers play a key role in companies that use artificial intelligence. They work hand-in-hand with data scientists, developers, and business teams to build and roll out AI tools that tackle real business challenges. This AI career typically requires: Understanding of machine learning algorithms and frameworks Strong programming skills in Python and other relevant languages Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) Knowledge of data structures and algorithms Proficiency in deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) While data scientists focus on analyzing data and creating models, AI engineers transform these models into practical, production-ready AI applications. Job Posting Specialization Score (JPSS) This description holds true for specialized AI engineer roles—but does this reflect the actual state of the AI engineer job market? That’s where the JPSS comes in! Our Job Posting Specialization Score (JPSS) analyzes job listings to determine whether companies prefer specialists with deep expertise in specific areas or generalists who can handle diverse tasks. This score helps reveal current hiring trends in the AI engineer job market. Our analysis examined job postings across 11 different skill categories. We assigned each posting a Job Posting Specialization Score (JPSS) based on the number of required skill categories, helping us understand what employers are looking for in 2025. We categorized the groups as follows: Here are the results: In contrast to other data roles—like data scientists ( see our 2025 research )—which value versatility, the AI engineering field heavily favors specialists. Our research shows that over 75% of job listings specifically seek domain experts—those with deep, focused knowledge in AI engineering—over than broader skill sets. That’s three in every four job postings. Unlike data analysts who primarily focus on core data skills with just basic knowledge of advanced topics like machine learning, AI engineers face a different challenge. For an AI career path, while you must have a solid foundation in basic data skills, your domain expertise comes into play with more complex topics. AI engineers need to be hands-on practitioners rather than theoretical experts—so make sure you master those AI applications and build a solid portfolio. For comprehensive training aligned with current market demands, consider the AI Engineer Career Track from 365 Data Science . It offers hands-on training in Python, LLMs, NLP, and practical AI development through building real-world applications like chat systems and vector databases. Still, almost a quarter of jobs are seeking professionals who can wear multiple hats and handle different aspects of AI work. If you're interested in these positions, take some time to study the job listings you're targeting and build up the exact mix of skills those companies want. Getting certifications in those areas is a great way to make your resume stand out. How Can You Become an AI Engineer ? Wondering how to become an AI engineer in today’s job market? Let’s look at what education and qualifications are employers looking for in 2025. AI Engineer Education Requirements Examining the AI engineer education requirements in 2025, our research shows that companies look for a mix when it comes to academic background and hands-on skills. That being said, in such a highly technical field, having a degree is essentially mandatory for artificial intelligence careers. Our research shows that you don't need a specialized AI degree to land this role . Artificial intelligence degrees were only mentioned in about 24% of postings. Engineering was the most popular degree for this role , appearing in nearly 70% of AI engineer job postings. Computer science followed closely behind at 61%. This strong preference for technical degrees highlights the role's focus on practical engineering and development skills rather than purely theoretical AI knowledge. Other frequently mentioned degrees include: machine learning (42%), data science (22%), and mathematics (15%). Another interesting finding was the high rate of architecture degrees mentioned in job listings. We've found throughout our research that architecture appears in most data-related roles—but never at this high of a rate. Over a quarter of the job postings mention this field, likely due to its highly analytical and practical nature. Now that you know what field you should focus on, let's examine what education level companies are looking for in AI engineer positions in 2025. During the 80s and 90s, careers in AI were almost exclusively academic. You'd typically need a PhD to contribute meaningfully to the field, and your work might revolve around publishing papers rather than shipping products. AI was “ pure research ”. Fast forward to 2025: AI is no longer just an academic discipline ; it’s a mainstream corporate function. The title AI Engineer is a distinct, in-demand role alongside more traditional software engineering jobs. As of 2025, there are more than 500,000 open roles globally for AI and ML engineers , with the largest concentrations in the US, India, and Western Europe. What does this mean for you? The education requirements for AI engineers are shifting—moving away from traditional academic PhDs and becoming more accepting of master's and even bachelor's degrees. Our data supports this trend: there is an almost even split among degree levels mentioned in AI engineer job postings . While PhDs remain the most frequently mentioned requirement at 28% of postings, master's and bachelor's degrees appear equally often, each mentioned in about 24% of listings. If you don't have an advanced degree, don't worry—a quarter of the job postings have no specific degree requirement. This indicates that, if you can prove your skills and showcase a strong portfolio of work, you'll still have plenty of opportunities in this field. You can enhance your bachelor's degree with targeted certifications from our learning platform 365 Data Science —we offer all the topics you need to secure a job this year!
