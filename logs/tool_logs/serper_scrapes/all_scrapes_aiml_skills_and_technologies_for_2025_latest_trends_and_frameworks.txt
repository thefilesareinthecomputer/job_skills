Share this item with your network: By Lev Craig, Site Editor Published: 03 Jan 2025 Generative AI is at a crossroads. It's now more than two years since ChatGPT's launch, and the initial optimism about AI's potential is decidedly tempered by an awareness of its limitations and costs. The 2025 AI landscape reflects that complexity. While excitement still abounds -- particularly for emerging areas, like agentic AI and multimodal models -- it's also poised to be a year of growing pains. Companies are increasingly looking for proven results from generative AI , rather than early-stage prototypes. That's no easy feat for a technology that's often expensive, error-prone and vulnerable to misuse. And regulators will need to balance innovation and safety, while keeping up with a fast-moving tech environment. Here are eight of the top AI trends to prepare for in 2025. 1. Hype gives way to more pragmatic approaches Since 2022, there's been an explosion of interest and innovation in generative AI, but actual adoption remains inconsistent. Companies often struggle to move generative AI projects, whether internal productivity tools or customer-facing applications, from pilot to production. This article is part of What is enterprise AI? A complete guide for businesses Which also includes: How can AI drive revenue? Here are 10 approaches 8 jobs that AI can't replace and why 8 AI and machine learning trends to watch in 2025 Although many businesses have explored generative AI through proofs of concept, fewer have fully integrated it into their operations. In a September 2024 research report , Informa TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found that, although over 90% of organizations had increased their generative AI use over the previous year, only 8% considered their initiatives mature. "The most surprising thing for me [in 2024] is actually the lack of adoption that we're seeing," said Jen Stave, launch director for the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard University. "When you look across businesses, companies are investing in AI. They're building their own custom tools. They're buying off-the-shelf enterprise versions of the large language models (LLMs). But there really hasn't been this groundswell of adoption within companies." One reason for this is AI's uneven impact across roles and job functions. Organizations are discovering what Stave termed the "jagged technological frontier," where AI enhances productivity for some tasks or employees, while diminishing it for others. A junior analyst, for example, might significantly increase their output by using a tool that only bogs down a more experienced counterpart. "Managers don't know where that line is, and employees don't know where that line is," Stave said. "So, there's a lot of uncertainty and experimentation." Despite the sky-high levels of generative AI hype, the reality of slow adoption is hardly a surprise to anyone with experience in enterprise tech. In 2025, expect businesses to push harder for measurable outcomes from generative AI: reduced costs, demonstrable ROI and efficiency gains. 2. Generative AI moves beyond chatbots When most laypeople hear the term generative AI , they think of tools like ChatGPT and Claude powered by LLMs. Early explorations from businesses, too, have tended to involve incorporating LLMs into products and services via chat interfaces. But, as the technology matures, AI developers, end users and business customers alike are looking beyond chatbots. "People need to think more creatively about how to use these base tools and not just try to plop a chat window into everything," said Eric Sydell, founder and CEO of Vero AI, an AI and analytics platform. This transition aligns with a broader trend: building software atop LLMs rather than deploying chatbots as standalone tools. Moving from chatbot interfaces to applications that use LLMs on the back end to summarize or parse unstructured data can help mitigate some of the issues that make generative AI difficult to scale. "[A chatbot] can help an individual be more effective ... but it's very one on one," Sydell said. "So, how do you scale that in an enterprise-grade way?" Heading into 2025, some areas of AI development are starting to move away from text-based interfaces entirely. Increasingly, the future of AI looks to center around multimodal models, like OpenAI's text-to-video Sora and ElevenLabs' AI voice generator, which can handle nontext data types, such as audio, video and images. "AI has become synonymous with large language models, but that's just one type of AI," Stave said. "It's this multimodal approach to AI [where] we're going to start seeing some major technological advancements." Robotics is another avenue for developing AI that goes beyond textual conversations -- in this case, to interact with the physical world. Stave anticipates that foundation models for robotics could be even more transformative than the arrival of generative AI. "Think about all of the different ways we interact with the physical world," she said. "I mean, the applications are just infinite." 3. AI agents are the next frontier The second half of 2024 has seen growing interest in agentic AI models capable of independent action. Tools like Salesforce's Agentforce are designed to autonomously handle tasks for business users, managing workflows and taking care of routine actions, like scheduling and data analysis. Agentic AI is in its early stages. Human direction and oversight remain critical, and the scope of actions that can be taken is usually narrowly defined. But, even with those limitations, AI agents are attractive for a wide range of sectors. Autonomous functionality isn't totally new, of course; by now, it's a well-established cornerstone of enterprise software. The difference with AI agents lies in their adaptability: Unlike simple automation software, agents can adapt to new information in real time, respond to unexpected obstacles and make independent decisions. Yet, that same independence also entails new risks. Grace Yee, senior director of ethical innovation at Adobe, warned of "the harm that can come ... as agents can start, in some cases, acting upon your behalf to help with scheduling or do other tasks." Generative AI tools are notoriously prone to hallucinations, or generating false information -- what happens if an autonomous agent makes similar mistakes with immediate, real-world consequences? Sydell cited similar concerns, noting that some use cases will raise more ethical issues than others. "When you start to get into high-risk applications -- things that have the potential to harm or help individuals -- the standards have to be way higher," he said. Compared with generative AI, agentic AI offers greater autonomy and adaptability. 4. Generative AI models become commodities The generative AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with foundation models seemingly now a dime a dozen. As 2025 begins, the competitive edge is moving away from which company has the best model to which businesses excel at fine-tuning pretrained models or developing specialized tools to layer on top of them. In a recent newsletter , analyst Benedict Evans compared the boom in generative AI models to the PC industry of the late 1980s and 1990s. In that era, performance comparisons focused on incremental improvements in specs like CPU speed or memory, similar to how today's generative AI models are evaluated on niche technical benchmarks. Over time, however, these distinctions faded as the market reached a good-enough baseline, with differentiation shifting to factors such as cost, UX and ease of integration. Foundation models seem to be on a similar trajectory: As performance converges, advanced models are becoming more or less interchangeable for many use cases. In a commoditized model landscape, the focus is no longer number of parameters or slightly better performance on a certain benchmark, but instead usability, trust and interoperability with legacy systems. In that environment, AI companies with established ecosystems, user-friendly tools and competitive pricing are likely to take the lead. 5. AI applications and data sets become more domain-specific Leading AI labs, like OpenAI and Anthropic, claim to be pursuing the ambitious goal of creating artificial general intelligence ( AGI ), commonly defined as AI that can perform any task a human can. But AGI -- or even the comparatively limited capabilities of today's foundation models -- is far from necessary for most business applications. For enterprises, interest in narrow, highly customized models started almost as soon as the generative AI hype cycle began. A narrowly tailored business application simply doesn't require the degree of versatility necessary for a consumer-facing chatbot. "There

AI in Action Five Trends in AI and Data Science for 2025 From agentic AI to unstructured data, these 2025 AI trends deserve close attention from leaders. Get fresh data and advice from two experts. Thomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean January 08, 2025 Reading Time: 11 min Topics Data, AI, & Machine Learning Managing Technology AI & Machine Learning Data & Data Culture IT Governance & Leadership Technology Implementation AI in Action This column series looks at the biggest data and analytics challenges facing modern companies and dives deep into successful use cases that can help other organizations accelerate their AI progress. More in this series Subscribe Share Twitter Facebook Linkedin Carolyn Geason-Beissel/MIT SMR | Getty Images This is the time of year for predictions and trend analyses, and as data science and artificial intelligence become increasingly important to the global economy, it’s vital that leaders watch emerging AI trends. Nobody seems to use AI to make these predictions, and we won’t either, as we share our list of AI trends that will matter in 2025. But we will incorporate the latest research whenever possible. Randy has just completed his annual survey of data, analytics, and AI executives, the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey , conducted by his educational firm, Data & AI Leadership Exchange; and Tom has worked on several surveys on generative AI and data, technology leadership structures, and, most recently, agentic AI. Here are the 2025 AI trends on our radar screens that leaders should understand and monitor. 1. Leaders will grapple with both the promise and hype around agentic AI. Let’s get agentic AI — the kind of AI that does tasks independently — out of the way first: It’s a sure bet for 2025’s “most trending AI trend.” Agentic AI seems to be on an inevitable rise: Everybody in the tech vendor and analyst worlds is excited about the prospect of having AI programs collaborate to do real work instead of just generating content, even though nobody is entirely sure how it will all work. Some IT leaders think they already have it (37%, in a forthcoming UiPath-sponsored survey of 252 U.S. IT leaders); most expect it soon and are ready to spend money on it (68% within six months or less); and a few skeptics (primarily encountered by us in interviews) think it’s mostly vendor hype. Most technology executives believe that these autonomous and collaborative AI programs will be primarily based on focused generative AI bots that will perform specific tasks. Most people believe that there will be a network of these agents, and many are hoping that the agent ecosystems will need less human intervention than AI has required in the past. Some believe that the technology will all be orchestrated by robotic process automation tools; some propose that agents will be fetched by enterprise transaction systems; and some posit the emergence of an “uber agent” that will control everything. The earliest agentic AI tools will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved. Here’s what we think: There will be (and in some cases, already are) generative AI bots that will do people’s bidding on specific content creation tasks. It will require more than one of these agentic AI tools to do something significant, such as make a travel reservation or conduct a banking transaction. But these systems still work by predicting the next word, and sometimes that will lead to errors or inaccuracies. So there will still be a need for humans to check in on them every now and then. The earliest agents will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved — for instance, helping change your password on the IT side, or reserving time off for vacations in HR systems. We don’t see much likelihood of companies turning these agents loose on real customers spending real money anytime soon, unless there’s the opportunity for human review or the reversal of a transaction. As a result, we don’t foresee a major impact on the human workforce from this technology in 2025, except for new jobs writing blog posts about agentic AI. (Wait, can agents do that?) 2. The time has come to measure results from generative AI experiments. One of the reasons why everybody is excited about agents is that as of 2024, it has still proved difficult to demonstrate economic value from generative AI. We argued in last year’s AI trends article that the value of GenAI still needed to be demonstrated. Data and AI leaders in Randy’s 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey said they are confident that GenAI value is being generated: Fifty-eight percent said that their organization has achieved exponential productivity or efficiency gains from AI, presumably mostly from generative AI. Another 16% said that they have “liberated knowledge workers from mundane tasks” through the use of GenAI tools. Let’s hope that these highly positive beliefs are correct. But companies shouldn’t take such confidence on faith. Very few companies are actually measuring productivity gains carefully or figuring out what the liberated knowledge workers are doing with their freed-up time. Only a few academic studies have measured GenAI productivity gains, and when they have, they’ve generally found some improvements, but not exponential ones. Goldman Sachs is one of the rare companies that has measured productivity gains in the area of programming . Developers there reported that their productivity increased by about 20%. Most similar studies have found contingent factors in productivity, where either inexperienced workers gain more (as in customer service and consulting) or experienced workers do better (as in code generation). In many cases, the best way to measure productivity gains will be to establish controlled experiments. For example, a company could have one group of marketers use generative AI to create content without human review, one use it with human review, and a control group not use it at all. Again, few companies are doing this, and this will need to change. Given that GenAI is primarily about content generation for many companies right now, if we want to really understand the benefits, we’ll also have to start measuring content quality. That’s notoriously difficult to do with knowledge work output. However, if GenAI helps write blog posts much faster but the posts are boring and inaccurate, that’s important to measure: There will be little benefit in that particular use case. The sad fact is that if many organizations are actually to achieve exponential productivity gains, those improvements may be measured in large-scale layoffs. But there is no sign of mass layoffs in the employment statistics. Additionally, a Nobel Prize winner in economics this year, MIT’s Daron Acemoglu , has commented that we haven’t seen real productivity gains from AI thus far, and he doesn’t expect to see anything dramatic over the next several years — perhaps a 0.5% increase over the next decade. In any case, if companies are really going to see and profit from GenAI, they’re going to need to measure and experiment to see the benefits. 3. Reality about data-driven culture sets in. We seem to be realizing that generative AI is very cool but doesn’t change everything, specifically long-term cultural attributes. In our trend article last year, we noted that Randy’s survey found that the percentage of company respondents who said that their organization had “created a data and AI-driven organization” and “established a data and AI-driven organizational culture” both doubled over the prior year (from 24% to 48% for creating data- and AI-driven organizations, and from 21% to 43% for establishing data-driven cultures). We were both somewhat astonished at this dramatic reported improvement, and we attributed the changes to generative AI, since it was very widely publicized and adopted rapidly by organizations. Our long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven. This year, the numbers have settled back to Earth a bit. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said they work in a data- and AI-driven organization, and 33% said they have a data- and AI-driven culture. It’s still a good thing that data and AI leaders feel that their organizations have improved in this regard over the distant past, but our long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven. In the same survey, 92% of the respondents said they feel that cultural and change management challenges are the primary barrier to becoming data- and AI-driven. This suggests that any technology alone is insufficient. It’s worth noting that most of the surveyed employees were from legacy organizations that were founded over a generation ago and have a history of transforming gradually. Many of these companies did more to execute on their digital strategies during the pandemic than they had in the previous two decades. 4. Unstructured data is important again. Generative AI has had another impact on organizations: It’s making unstructured data important again. In the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey, 94% of data and AI leaders said that interest in AI is leading to a greater focus on data. Since traditional analytical AI has been around for several decades, we think they were referring to GenAI’s impact. In another survey that we mentioned in last year’s AI trends article, there was substantial evidence that most companies hadn’t yet started to really manage data to get ready for generative AI. The great majority of the data that GenAI works with is relatively unstructured, in forms such as text, images, video, and the like. A leader at one large insurance organization recently shared with Randy that 97% of the company’s data was unstructured. Many companies are interested in using GenAI to help manage and provide access to their own da

In addition, Artificial Intelligence is moving into new domains. The process includes conceptual design, smaller devices, and multimodal applications, expanding its influence in many industries. With that in mind, the market for AI and ML continues to experience robust growth. According to a report, the global AI market is expected to reach $ 3,680.47 billion by 2034 . This rapid growth is largely fueled by advancements in machine learning tools and the need for automation across industries. Specifically, machine learning has seen significant investment as organizations look to integrate advanced ML technologies into business operations . As a matter of fact, 56% of companies are implementing AI to enhance and streamline their business operations. This statistic has underlined the technology’s increasing role in enhancing productivity. In short, the demand for skilled professionals in AI and machine learning trends continues to grow. Companies are increasingly recognizing the value of in-house expertise in managing, implementing, and scaling AI solutions effectively. 10 AI and Machine Learning Trends for 2025 As we approach 2025, AI and machine learning trends continue to shape how industries operate, interact with customers, and make data-driven decisions. Here’s a look at ten key trends that are expected to dominate the AI and ML landscape in 2025. Multimodal AI Multimodal AI, which integrates and processes information from multiple data sources like text, images, and audio, will grow significantly. By 2025, the technology will allow systems to understand and respond to complex inputs more naturally. Ultimately, it will create a seamless experience for users. For example, customer support chatbots will soon be able to handle both text and images. In this case, a customer could upload a picture of a damaged product, and the chatbot would respond more quickly and accurately. Similarly, this approach could be widely applied in fields like healthcare. Interpreting various data types, such as medical images and patient records, will lead to more comprehensive insights and improved diagnostics. Explainable AI (XAI) With the increased reliance on AI for critical business, XAI will become an essential part of AI and machine learning trends. Explainable AI will play a critical role in helping businesses understand, interpret, and trust the outputs of their AI systems. Most importantly, this trend is driven by the need for transparency, especially in sectors where high-stakes decisions are made. For instance, XAI could explain why certain credit applications are approved or denied, promoting fairness and accountability. By making AI models more interpretable, organizations will comply with regulatory standards and improve user trust in automated systems. Ethical AI As AI’s influence expands, the importance of ethical artificial intelligence will only intensify. Businesses will be under growing pressure to adopt ethical AI practices to ensure their systems are fair, unbiased, and transparent. For the obvious reason, AI ethics will become a core component of AI governance. Consequently, companies will actively work to eliminate biases from their algorithms. They will also place a strong emphasis on data privacy and accountability. This AI and machine learning trend will lead to the creation of AI ethics teams in organizations. They will be able to oversee the responsible development and deployment of the artificial intelligence solution. Additionally, consumers are increasingly aware of AI ethics. Therefore, companies that emphasize ethical AI will stand out as trusted brands in a competitive market. Edge AI Edge AI enables data processing close to its source rather than relying on cloud computing alone. This technology is poised for substantial growth by 2025.
