TensorFlow Learn TensorFlow Core Guide Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. TensorFlow 2 focuses on simplicity and ease of use, with updates like eager execution, intuitive higher-level APIs, and flexible model building on any platform. Many guides are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google Colab—a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup. Click the Run in Google Colab button. Essential documentation Install TensorFlow Install the package or build from source. GPU support for CUDA®-enabled cards. Migrate to TensorFlow 2 Learn how to migrate your TF1.x code to TF2. Keras Keras is a high-level API that's easier for ML beginners, as well as researchers. TensorFlow basics Learn about the fundamental classes and features that make TensorFlow work. Data input pipelines The tf.data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. TensorFlow 2 best practices Learn about the best practices for effective development using TensorFlow 2. Save a model Save a TensorFlow model using checkpoints or the SavedModel format. Accelerators Distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs. Performance Best practices and optimization techniques for optimal TensorFlow performance. Libraries and extensions Explore additional resources to build advanced models or methods using TensorFlow, and access domain-specific application packages that extend TensorFlow. chevron_right TensorFlow Decision Forests A library to train, run and interpret decision forest models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) in TensorFlow. chevron_right TensorFlow Hub A library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. chevron_right Serving A TFX serving system for ML models, designed for high-performance in production environments. chevron_right TensorFlow Federated A framework for machine learning and other computations on decentralized data. chevron_right Neural Structured Learning A learning paradigm to train neural networks by leveraging structured signals in addition to feature inputs. chevron_right TensorFlow Graphics A library of computer graphics functionalities ranging from cameras, lights, and materials to renderers. chevron_right SIG Addons Extra functionality for TensorFlow, maintained by SIG Addons. chevron_right TensorBoard A suite of visualization tools to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs. chevron_right Datasets A collection of datasets ready to use with TensorFlow. chevron_right Model Optimization The TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit is a suite of tools for optimizing ML models for deployment and execution. chevron_right Probability TensorFlow Probability is a library for probabilistic reasoning and statistical analysis. chevron_right MLIR MLIR unifies the infrastructure for high-performance ML models in TensorFlow. chevron_right XLA A domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that accelerates TensorFlow models with potentially no source code changes. chevron_right SIG IO Dataset, streaming, and file system extensions, maintained by SIG IO.
