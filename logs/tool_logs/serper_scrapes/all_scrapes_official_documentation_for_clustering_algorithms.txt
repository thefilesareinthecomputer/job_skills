2.3. Clustering # Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module sklearn.cluster . Each clustering algorithm comes in two variants: a class, that implements the fit method to learn the clusters on train data, and a function, that, given train data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding to the different clusters. For the class, the labels over the training data can be found in the labels_ attribute. Input data One important thing to note is that the algorithms implemented in this module can take different kinds of matrix as input. All the methods accept standard data matrices of shape (n_samples, n_features) . These can be obtained from the classes in the sklearn.feature_extraction module. For AffinityPropagation , SpectralClustering and DBSCAN one can also input similarity matrices of shape (n_samples, n_samples) . These can be obtained from the functions in the sklearn.metrics.pairwise module. 2.3.1.

Large n_clusters and n_samples Large dataset, outlier removal, data reduction, inductive Euclidean distance between points Bisecting K-Means number of clusters Very large n_samples , medium n_clusters General-purpose, even cluster size, flat geometry, no empty clusters, inductive, hierarchical Distances between points Non-flat geometry clustering is useful when the clusters have a specific shape, i.e. a non-flat manifold, and the standard euclidean distance is not the right metric. This case arises in the two top rows of the figure above. Gaussian mixture models, useful for clustering, are described in another chapter of the documentation dedicated to mixture models. KMeans can be seen as a special case of Gaussian mixture model with equal covariance per component. Transductive clustering methods (in contrast to inductive clustering methods) are not designed to be applied to new, unseen data. 2.3.2. K-means # The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large numbers of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields. The k-means algorithm divides a set of \(N\) samples \(X\) into \(K\) disjoint clusters \(C\) , each described by the mean \(\mu_j\) of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster “centroids”; note that they are not, in general, points from \(X\) , although they live in the same space. The K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the inertia , or within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion : \[\sum_{i=0}^{n}\min_{\mu_j \in C}(||x_i - \mu_j||^2)\] Inertia can be recognized as a measure of how internally coherent clusters are. It suffers from various drawbacks: Inertia makes the assumption that clusters are convex and isotropic, which is not always the case. It responds poorly to elongated clusters, or manifolds with irregular shapes. Inertia is not a normalized metric: we just know that lower values are better and zero is optimal. But in very high-dimensional spaces, Euclidean distances tend to become inflated (this is an instance of the so-called “curse of dimensionality”). Running a dimensionality reduction algorithm such as Principal component analysis (PCA) prior to k-means clustering can alleviate this problem and speed up the computations. For more detailed descriptions of the issues shown above and how to address them, refer to the examples Demonstration of k-means assumptions and Selecting the number of clusters with silhouette analysis on KMeans clustering . K-means is often referred to as Lloyd’s algorithm. In basic terms, the algorithm has three steps. The first step chooses the initial centroids, with the most basic method being to choose \(k\) samples from the dataset \(X\) . After initialization, K-means consists of looping between the two other steps. The first step assigns each sample to its nearest centroid. The second step creates new centroids by taking the mean value of all of the samples assigned to each previous centroid. The difference between the old and the new centroids are computed and the algorithm repeats these last two steps until this value is less than a threshold. In other words, it repeats until the centroids do not move significantly. K-means is equivalent to the expectation-maximization algorithm with a small, all-equal, diagonal covariance matrix. The algorithm can also be understood through the concept of Voronoi diagrams . First the Voronoi diagram of the points is calculated using the current centroids. Each segment in the Voronoi diagram becomes a separate cluster. Secondly, the centroids are updated to the mean of each segment. The algorithm then repeats this until a stopping criterion is fulfilled. Usually, the algorithm stops when the relative decrease in the objective function between iterations is less than the given tolerance value. This is not the case in this implementation: iteration stops when centroids move less than the tolerance. Given enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local minimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids. As a result, the computation is often done several times, with different initializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the k-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn (use the init='k-means++' parameter). This initializes the centroids to be (generally) distant from each other, leading to probably better results than random initialization, as shown in the reference. For detailed examples of comparing different initialization schemes, refer to A demo of K-Means clustering on the handwritten digits data and Empirical evaluation of the impact of k-means initialization . K-means++ can also be called independently to select seeds for other clustering algorithms, see sklearn.cluster.kmeans_plusplus for details and example usage. The algorithm supports sample weights, which can be given by a parameter sample_weight . This allows to assign more weight to some samples when computing cluster centers and values of inertia. For example, assigning a weight of 2 to a sample is equivalent to adding a duplicate of that sample to the dataset \(X\) .

Low-level parallelism # KMeans benefits from OpenMP based parallelism through Cython. Small chunks of data (256 samples) are processed in parallel, which in addition yields a low memory footprint.

Mini Batch K-Means # The MiniBatchKMeans is a variant of the KMeans algorithm which uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting to optimise the same objective function. Mini-batches are subsets of the input data, randomly sampled in each training iteration. These mini-batches drastically reduce the amount of computation required to converge to a local solution. In contrast to other algorithms that reduce the convergence time of k-means, mini-batch k-means produces results that are generally only slightly worse than the sta

Machine learning datasets can have millions of examples, but not all clustering algorithms scale efficiently. Many clustering algorithms compute the similarity between all pairs of examples, which means their runtime increases as the square of the number of examples \(n\), denoted as \(O(n^2)\) in complexity notation. \(O(n^2)\) algorithms are not practical for datasets with millions of examples. The k-means algorithm has a complexity of \(O(n)\), meaning that the algorithm scales linearly with \(n\). This algorithm will be the focus of this course. Types of clustering For an exhaustive list of different approaches to clustering, see A Comprehensive Survey of Clustering Algorithms Xu, D. & Tian, Y. Ann. Data. Sci. (2015) 2: 165. Each approach is best suited to a particular data distribution. This course briefly discusses four common approaches. Centroid-based clustering The centroid of a cluster is the arithmetic mean of all the points in the cluster. Centroid-based clustering organizes the data into non-hierarchical clusters. Centroid-based clustering algorithms are efficient but sensitive to initial conditions and outliers. Of these, k-means is the most widely used. It requires users to define the number of centroids, k , and works well with clusters of roughly equal size. Figure 1: Example of centroid-based clustering. Density-based clustering Density-based clustering connects contiguous areas of high example density into clusters. This allows for the discovery of any number of clusters of any shape. Outliers are not assigned to clusters. These algorithms have difficulty with clusters of different density and data with high dimensions. Figure 2: Example of density-based clustering. Distribution-based clustering This clustering approach assumes data is composed of probabilistic distributions, such as Gaussian distributions . In Figure 3, the distribution-based algorithm clusters data into three Gaussian distributions. As distance from the distribution's center increases, the probability that a point belongs to the distribution decreases. The bands show that decrease in probability. When you're not comfortable assuming a particular underlying distribution of the data, you should use a different algorithm. Figure 3: Example of distribution-based clustering. Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, not surprisingly, is well suited to hierarchical data, such as taxonomies. See Comparison of 61 Sequenced Escherichia coli Genomes by Oksana Lukjancenko, Trudy Wassenaar & Dave Ussery for an example. Any number of clusters can be chosen by cutting the tree at the right level. Figure 4: Example of a hierarchical tree clustering animals.

Read our Privacy Policy. Introduction Clustering is a powerful unsupervised machine-learning technique that involves grouping data points based on their similarities. Unlike supervised learning, where models are trained with labeled data, clustering operates without predefined categories or outcomes. The core idea is to find natural groupings within a dataset, where items in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. One of the key distinctions between clustering and supervised learning is that clustering does not require labeled data. This makes it particularly valuable in exploratory data analysis, where the goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data. Clustering can reveal insights that might not be apparent through other analytical methods, making it a versatile tool in the data scientist’s toolkit. The practical applications of clustering are manifold. In marketing, it helps businesses segment customers for personalized strategies. It’s behind many content organization systems, grouping similar documents or images together. In genetics, it can uncover patterns in biological data. And in cybersecurity, clustering helps detect anomalies that could signal potential threats. In this guide, we’ll further discuss some common use cases, then break down different clustering algorithms – from the classic and widely-used K-means method to the more flexible hierarchical clustering and the density-based DBSCAN and HDBSCAN techniques. We’ll tackle the tricky question of how to pick the right algorithm for your specific problem and evaluate how well (or if) your clustering is working. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or just getting started with machine learning, this guide aims to give you a solid grasp of clustering – what it is, how it works, and how to use it effectively in your projects. Use Cases of Clustering Clustering has many real-world applications that drive significant value across a wide range of fields and industries. Here are a few examples to illustrate the power of clustering in real-world scenarios: Customer Segmentation. In marketing, understanding customer behavior is crucial for tailoring personalized strategies. Clustering helps businesses segment their customers based on purchasing patterns, preferences, and demographics. For instance, a retail company might use K-means clustering to group customers based on factors like purchase frequency, average order value, and types of products bought. This allows them to tailor marketing campaigns for each segment, such as offering premium product recommendations to high-value customers or re-engagement campaigns for customers at risk of churn. Image and Document Clustering. Clustering plays a significant role in organizing large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, or videos, making retrieval faster and more efficient. For example, clustering can be used to group news articles or academic papers by topic, enabling readers to find related content easily. Similarly, photo management applications often use clustering to group images by similar features, such as events, locations, or themes, making it easier for users to navigate their photo libraries. Anomaly Detection. In the realm of cybersecurity, detecting anomalies is essential for identifying potential threats. Clustering algorithms can sift through network data to identify patterns that deviate from the norm, such as unusual login attempts or data transfer activities, flagging these anomalies for further investigation. Similarly, for fraud detection, clustering can help identify unusual transactions by grouping normal transaction patterns and flagging those that don’t fit into any established cluster. Biomedical Data Clustering. Clustering also plays a vital role in genetics and biomedical research. By grouping similar genetic data, researchers can uncover patterns and relationships that can be crucial for understanding diseases and developing treatments. This can lead to breakthroughs in personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the genetic profiles of individual patients. Clustering Algorithms Demystified: An Overview Let’s dive into some of the most popular clustering algorithms. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so understanding how they work is key to choosing the right tool for your data. K-means Clustering K-means is one of the simplest and most widely used clustering algorithms. It partitions data into K clusters, where K is a number you specify in advance. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean. Since K-means relies on Euclidean distance, it can only be used with numerical, not cat

Clustering and classification are machine learning methods for finding the similarities – and differences – in a set of data or documents. These methods can be used for such tasks as grouping products in a product catalog, finding cohorts of similar customers, or aggregating sets of documents by topic, team, or office. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning Classifications take a set of data that you’ve already manually analyzed and labeled and uses that to train a learning model to then examine a set of new data. This is called supervised learning. Clustering on the other hand, doesn’t require an existing data set that’s been labeled by humans but still tries to find the groupings and differences in the data. This is called unsupervised learning. The Crisis of Unlabeled Data Without clustering algorithms and classification techniques, search results become watered down and non-specific. Business users and admins have to spend too much time manually adjusting relevancy and precision. Let machine learning do the work so you can focus your time and resources where they matter most. Lucidworks Makes Clustering and Classification Easy Lucidworks ships with clustering and classification algorithms that are pre-tuned by our data scientists drawing on our expertise with customers around the world.
