```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### R
**Definition:** R is primarily used for statistical computing and graphics, making it invaluable for data analysis in AI/ML workflows.

**Applications in Real Projects:** R excels in statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization with packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and caret.

**Example:** Building a simple linear regression in R can be demonstrated as follows:
```r
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

**Applications in Real Projects:** SQL assists in effective data manipulation, aggregation, and preparation for model training.

**Example:** A common SQL query to retrieve data could look like:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(purchase_id) as total_purchases 
FROM purchases 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### PyTorch
**Definition:** PyTorch is an open-source ML library that provides tools for building deep learning networks dynamically.

**Applications in Real Projects:** PyTorch is favored in research and development due to its ease of use in prototyping.

**Example:** Implementing a CNN with PyTorch:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 13 * 13, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 13 * 13)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x
```

**Resources:**

- Tutorials at PyTorch's official documentation.

### Scikit-learn
**Definition:** Scikit-learn is a powerful library for classical machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.

**Applications in Real Projects:** It allows the implementation of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.

**Example:** Evaluating a Scikit-learn model can be done with:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]
y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 0]
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))
```

**Resources:**

## Machine Learning Techniques

### Deep Learning
**Definition:** Deep learning refers to a subset of machine learning techniques based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

**Applications in Real Projects:** Deep learning has been widely used in image analysis, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

### Transfer Learning
**Definition:** Transfer learning uses knowledge gained from one task to enhance performance in a related task, often utilizing pre-trained models.

**Applications in Real Projects:** A common use of transfer learning is using models like BERT or VGG16 for specialized tasks after pre-training.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
**Definition:** NLP is a field at the intersection of AI and linguistics focused on enabling machines to understand and interpret human language.

**Applications in Real Projects:** NLP techniques are applied in sentiment analysis, chatbots, and translation services.

**Example:** An example of text classification with NLTK in Python:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews

# Load the movie review dataset
nltk.download('movie_reviews')

# Classify words from the positive and negative reviews
for file_id in movie_reviews.fileids('pos')[:5]:
    print(movie_reviews.words(file_id))
```
